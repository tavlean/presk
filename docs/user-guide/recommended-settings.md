# Recommended settings (community guidance)

> **What this page is.** A consolidated, per-codec cheat sheet of **community best-practice settings** — gathered from Google/encoder docs and widely-shared web-developer practice — expressed in Sqush's own UI controls. It is a companion to the per-format pages, which carry the same advice in context alongside the code-derived factual reference.
>
> **What this page is _not_.** None of this changes how Sqush behaves today. The "Could become a default/preset" column is a forward-looking wishlist for the maintainer, not a description of current defaults. Sqush's **current** factual defaults are documented authoritatively in each format page and in the [Formats & options reference](./reference/formats-and-options.md); where a recommendation differs from the current default, that's called out explicitly.

Each codec section links to its full page for the reasoning, ranges, and sources.

## WebP — [full page](./formats/webp.md)

| Use case                              | Recommended (Sqush controls)                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web photo (lossy)                     | Quality 75–80, Effort 6                                         |
| Graphics / screenshots / line art     | Lossless on (Effort 6), or near-lossless via Slight loss ~40   |
| Sharp content kept lossy              | Quality ≥ 90                                                    |
| Transparency / alpha                  | Lossy Quality ~90, Alpha quality 100                           |
| Re-encoding an existing JPEG          | Lossy Quality ~80 (never Lossless)                             |

**Current Sqush default:** lossy, Quality 80, Effort 6 (updated 2026-06-03 from the upstream-Squoosh 75/4 — the "Web photo" recommendation below is now the shipped default).

**Could become a default/preset:** auto-suggesting **Lossless** when the source is a PNG or has an alpha channel or looks like a flat-color screenshot, since lossy WebP visibly hurts that material. (The earlier "Quality 80 / Effort 6 preset" suggestion is now the default.)

## AVIF — [full page](./formats/avif.md)

| Use case                              | Recommended (Sqush controls)                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Web photo (lossy)                     | Quality 60–70, Effort 6, 4:2:0, Tuning SSIM                        |
| Graphics / screenshots / text         | Quality 80–88, 4:4:4, Effort 5–6                                   |
| Transparency / alpha                  | Quality 70–80, Separate alpha quality matched to color            |
| Archival / max-fidelity               | Lossless on (forces 4:4:4), Effort 6–8 — or steer toward JPEG XL  |

**Current Sqush default:** lossy, Quality 50, Effort 4, 4:2:0, Tuning Auto.

**Could become a default/preset:** a "Web photo" preset around Quality 60–65 / Effort 6; a "Graphic/screenshot" preset that forces 4:4:4 and raises quality to ~85; surfacing Effort more prominently, since it swings file size 20–30% at no quality cost.

## JPEG XL — [full page](./formats/jpeg-xl.md)

| Use case                              | Recommended (Sqush controls)                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web photo, high quality               | Quality ~90 (≈ distance 1.0), Effort 7                        |
| Lighter web weight                    | Quality 75–85, Effort 7                                       |
| Graphics / line art                   | Lossless on, Effort 7 (5 also fine)                           |
| Transparency / alpha                  | Lossless on, or Quality ~90, Effort 7                         |
| Archival / masters                    | Lossless on, Effort 7–9                                       |

**Current Sqush default:** lossy, Quality 75, Effort 7.

**Could become a default/preset:** Effort 7 is already the right default and is on the Pareto front — keep it. A "visually lossless" preset at Quality ~90 would match the most-cited recommendation. (Bit-exact lossless JPEG → JXL transcoding is a libjxl feature Sqush does not currently do, since it re-encodes from decoded pixels.)

## JPEG — [full page](./formats/mozjpeg.md)

Encoded with **MozJPEG** (shown as **JPEG** in the menu; the encoder name appears as a hover tooltip).

| Use case                              | Recommended (Sqush controls)                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| General web photography (default)     | Quality 80–85, Progressive on, Trellis multipass on, chroma auto (4:2:0) |
| Thumbnails / retina (2×)              | Quality 60–70, Progressive on, 4:2:0                                      |
| Text / screenshots / sharp edges      | Quality 90+, Auto subsample off + Subsample chroma by 1 (4:4:4)          |
| Max-quality / archival                | Quality 92–95, 4:4:4, full trellis, Trellis passes 2                      |
| Smallest file (slow)                  | Quality 72–80, full trellis, Progressive on, 4:2:0                        |

**Current Sqush default:** Quality 75, Progressive on, Trellis multipass off, quant table ImageMagick.

**Could become a default/preset:** raise the default Quality from 75 to ~80 and turn **Trellis multipass** on by default — trellis is the whole reason to use MozJPEG over plain libjpeg, so leaving it off ships a weaker default. Optionally auto-switch to 4:4:4 when Quality ≥ 90.

## PNG — [full page](./formats/oxipng.md)

Encoded with **OxiPNG** (shown as **PNG** in the menu; the encoder name appears as a hover tooltip).

| Use case                              | Recommended (Sqush controls)      |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Interactive single-image (default)    | Effort 2, Interlace off           |
| You can wait (balanced)               | Effort 4, Interlace off           |
| Absolute smallest PNG (one-off)       | Effort 6 (max), Interlace off     |

**Current Sqush default:** Effort 2, Interlace off.

**Could become a default/preset:** keep Effort 2 — it matches OxiPNG's own default and is correct for interactive use; the diminishing-returns-vs-runtime curve makes raising it the wrong call. Interlace already correctly defaults off. A one-click "Balanced (Effort 4)" affordance for users willing to wait would be a nice addition.

## Image Resize — [full page](./resize.md)

| Use case                              | Recommended (Sqush controls)                              |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Downscaling photographs               | Lanczos3, Premultiply on, Linear RGB on                   |
| Flat graphics / illustrations         | Mitchell (or Catmull-Rom), Premultiply on, Linear RGB on  |
| Upscaling / enlarging                 | Lanczos3 generally; Mitchell if halos appear              |
| Pixel art / sprites                   | hqx (pixel art), or Browser pixelated — integer scale only |

**Current Sqush default:** Lanczos3, Premultiply on, Linear RGB on.

**Could become a default/preset:** the current default already matches community best practice — keep it. Possible additions: auto-suggest **Mitchell** when the source looks like flat graphics (to dodge ringing), and an optional **post-resize sharpen** (unsharp mask) for photos, since downscaling inherently softens.

## Reduce palette (libimagequant) — [full page](./reduce-palette.md)

| Use case                              | Recommended (Sqush controls)               |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Flat graphics: logos, icons, UI       | Colors 32–128, Dithering 0 (or ~0.2–0.5)   |
| Illustrations / few-color art         | Colors 128, Dithering ~0.3                 |
| Gradient / photographic-to-palette    | Colors 256, Dithering 1.0                  |

**Current Sqush default:** Colors 256, Dithering 1.0.

**Could become a default/preset:** reconsider the default Dithering of 1.0 — full dithering is right for gradients but actively worse (bigger + noisier) on the flat-graphics images that are the prime use case for palette reduction. A content-aware default (e.g. Dithering 0 for detected flat/low-color images, 1.0 for gradient-heavy ones) would serve the common case better. Always running OxiPNG after quantization is the recommended pairing.

## At-a-glance: where current defaults already match best practice

| Codec / tool      | Default already optimal?                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WebP              | **Yes (since 2026-06-03)** — default is now Quality 80 / Effort 6, matching the web consensus. |
| AVIF              | Quality 50 is conservative; community leans ~60–70 for photos. Effort under-surfaced.    |
| JPEG XL           | **Yes** — Effort 7 is the Pareto-front sweet spot; Quality 75 is reasonable.             |
| JPEG              | Quality 75 is a touch low; Trellis off is the notable gap vs the codec's whole point.    |
| PNG               | **Yes** — Effort 2 matches OxiPNG's own default and suits interactive use.               |
| Image Resize      | **Yes** — Lanczos3 + Linear RGB + Premultiply is the recommended photographic default.   |
| Reduce palette    | Partly — Colors 256 is a safe default; Dithering 1.0 hurts the flat-graphic common case. |
