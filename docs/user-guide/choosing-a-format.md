# Choosing a format

> A plain-language guide to picking the right output format in Sqush — when to use the modern formats (WebP, AVIF, JPEG XL), when to stick with the universal ones (JPEG, PNG), and when to leave the image untouched.

## Overview / When to use it

Sqush lets you re-encode an image into a different format to make it smaller, sharper, or more widely compatible. The format you pick is the single biggest factor in the size-versus-quality trade-off. This page is a decision guide: it explains the difference between _lossy_ and _lossless_ compression, matches formats to the kind of image you have (a photo, a flat-color graphic, a screenshot, something with transparency), and tells you which formats are safe to put on the public web today. None of this changes where your image goes — everything is processed on your own device and nothing is uploaded.

First, two words you'll see everywhere:

- **Lossy** compression throws away detail your eye is unlikely to notice in exchange for much smaller files. Great for photographs. Re-saving a lossy file repeatedly slowly degrades it. (src: developer.mozilla.org — image file types)
- **Lossless** compression keeps every pixel exactly as it was; the file is just packed more efficiently. Essential for graphics with sharp edges, text, or where you can't accept any change. Files are bigger than lossy.

## Quick "use X when…" table

| Your image is…                                     | Best starting format                                   | Why                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A photograph (lots of color, soft gradients)       | **AVIF**, or **WebP** for wider reach                  | Modern lossy codecs beat JPEG noticeably at the same quality           |
| A photo that must open _everywhere_ with zero risk | **MozJPEG**                                            | The universal lossy format; opens in everything                        |
| A logo, icon, flat-color illustration, or chart    | **OxiPNG** (or **WebP lossless**)                      | Lossless keeps edges and text crisp                                    |
| A screenshot                                       | **OxiPNG**, or **WebP** if it has photographic content | Crisp UI text stays sharp losslessly; mixed content can go WebP        |
| Anything needing **transparency**                  | **WebP**, **AVIF**, **JPEG XL**, or **OxiPNG**         | All support an alpha channel; JPEG does not                            |
| An **animation**                                   | **Browser GIF** _(if available — see note)_            | The only animation-capable format here; usually unavailable in-browser |
| You're already happy with the file                 | **Original Image**                                     | No re-encoding; downloads the file unchanged                           |
| You want the absolute smallest, support be damned  | **AVIF** or **JPEG XL**                                | Best compression, but check browser support before shipping            |

A note on animation: Sqush's only animation-capable encoder is **Browser GIF**, and it relies on the browser's own `canvas.toBlob` support for GIF, which most browsers do not provide — so it is usually filtered out and won't appear in the list. There is no general-purpose animated-WebP/AVIF export here.

## Controls / Settings

The format chooser is the dropdown at the top of each side's **Compress** panel. The exact roster is defined in `src/lib/compress.ts` (`OUTPUT_FORMATS`). The modern WASM codecs (WebP, AVIF, JPEG XL, MozJPEG, OxiPNG, QOI) are always available. The three **Browser** encoders are feature-detected at runtime via `canvas.toBlob`, so they only appear if your browser actually supports them.

### Original Image

- **What it does:** Leaves the image completely untouched — no re-encoding. Both the before and after previews show the same (rotated, if you rotated it) source pixels, and the download is the original file byte-for-byte.
- **Range & default:** It is the special `identity` pseudo-format, not a real encoder. It is always the first entry in the dropdown, shown as "Original Image (your-filename)". It has no Compress options, and the Resize / Reduce-palette ("Edit") controls are hidden for this side.
- **How to choose:** Use it as the baseline on one side so you can compare a re-encoded version against the real original. Choose it as your final output when the file is already as good as you want and you only opened Sqush to inspect or rotate.
- **Recommended starting point:** **Keep one side on Original** while you tune the other side — it's the honest yardstick. Deviate when you actually want a smaller or different-format file.

### WebP

- **What it does:** A modern format from Google that does both lossy (photo) and lossless (graphics) compression, with transparency support. A strong all-rounder that is smaller than JPEG/PNG while being supported almost everywhere.
- **Range & default:** id `webP`, extension `.webp`, MIME `image/webp`. Supports both lossy and lossless (toggled by a **Lossless** checkbox in its panel).
- **How to choose:** This is the safe modern default. For photos, leave it lossy and adjust Quality. For logos/screenshots, turn Lossless on. If you can only pick one modern format to ship widely, WebP is it because support is essentially universal across current browsers. (src: caniuse.com — webp)
- **Recommended starting point:** **WebP, lossy, for photos; WebP lossless for flat graphics.** Deviate to AVIF/JPEG XL when you want even smaller files and your audience's browsers can handle them.

### AVIF

- **What it does:** A modern format based on the AV1 video codec. Typically gives the smallest files at a given quality, with strong lossless and transparency support — at the cost of slower encoding.
- **Range & default:** id `avif`, extension `.avif`, MIME `image/avif`. Supports both lossy and lossless (Lossless checkbox in its panel).
- **How to choose:** Best pick when small size matters most for photos and rich images. The trade-off is encode speed: AVIF is the slowest of the modern codecs here, and higher "Effort" makes it slower still. Browser support is now broad across current Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge, though older devices may miss it, so JPEG/WebP remain the safer fallbacks. (src: caniuse.com — avif)
- **Recommended starting point:** **AVIF for photos when you want the smallest file and can wait for encoding.** Deviate to WebP if you need the absolute widest reach or faster turnaround.

### JPEG XL (beta)

- **What it does:** A modern format designed to replace JPEG, with excellent quality-per-byte, true lossless, transparency, and even lossless re-compression of existing JPEGs. Marked beta here.
- **Range & default:** id `jxl`, extension `.jxl`, MIME `image/jxl`. Supports both lossy and lossless. Its label is read from the codec, hence "JPEG XL (beta)".
- **How to choose:** Excellent compression and quality, but browser support is the catch: as of 2025 it ships in Safari, while Chrome and Firefox do not enable it by default. Treat output as great for archiving or supported pipelines, not for general web delivery yet. (src: caniuse.com — jpegxl)
- **Recommended starting point:** **Use for archival, experiments, or Safari-targeted delivery.** Deviate to WebP/AVIF when you need broad browser support today.

### MozJPEG

- **What it does:** A highly tuned JPEG encoder. Produces standard `.jpg` files that open literally everywhere, but smaller than a typical JPEG at the same quality. Lossy only; no transparency.
- **Range & default:** id `mozJPEG`, extension `.jpg`, MIME `image/jpeg`. Lossy only.
- **How to choose:** The universal-compatibility choice for photos. Pick it when the file must open on any device, browser, or old software with zero risk, and you don't need transparency. It can't match AVIF/WebP on size, but nothing beats it on reach.
- **Recommended starting point:** **MozJPEG for photos that must be maximally compatible.** Deviate to WebP/AVIF when your audience's browsers are modern and you want smaller files.

### OxiPNG

- **What it does:** A lossless PNG optimizer. Keeps every pixel exactly, supports transparency, and squeezes the PNG as small as it can go. Ideal for sharp-edged graphics and text.
- **Range & default:** id `oxiPNG`, extension `.png`, MIME `image/png`. Lossless only.
- **How to choose:** The universal-compatibility choice for graphics, logos, icons, screenshots of UI/text, and anything needing crisp edges or transparency. PNG opens everywhere. For flat-color images it can rival or beat lossy formats; for photographs it will be much larger than JPEG/WebP/AVIF.
- **Recommended starting point:** **OxiPNG for flat-color graphics, logos, and crisp screenshots.** Deviate to WebP lossless if you want even smaller files and modern-browser delivery; deviate to a lossy format if the image is actually a photo.

### QOI

- **What it does:** A very simple, very fast lossless format (the "Quite OK Image" format). Encodes and decodes quickly but compresses less than PNG/WebP.
- **Range & default:** id `qoi`, extension `.qoi`, MIME `image/qoi`. Lossless. It has **no adjustable options** — its panel just says so.
- **How to choose:** Niche. Use when you specifically want QOI for a tool or pipeline that reads it. It is not a web-deliverable format and won't open as an image in browsers.
- **Recommended starting point:** **Skip unless you have a specific reason to want QOI.**

### Browser JPEG

- **What it does:** A JPEG produced by your browser's built-in encoder (via `canvas.toBlob`) instead of MozJPEG. Lossy, standard `.jpg`, runs on the main thread.
- **Range & default:** id `browserJPEG`, extension `.jpg`, MIME `image/jpeg`. Lossy. Feature-detected — only appears if your browser supports JPEG in `canvas.toBlob` (most do). Its single Quality control uses a **0–1** scale, unlike the WASM encoders' 0–100.
- **How to choose:** A lightweight fallback. MozJPEG generally gives smaller, better JPEGs, so prefer it; reach for Browser JPEG only if you specifically want the browser's native output.
- **Recommended starting point:** **Prefer MozJPEG;** use Browser JPEG only as a quick native fallback.

### Browser PNG

- **What it does:** A PNG produced by your browser's built-in encoder. Lossless, standard `.png`.
- **Range & default:** id `browserPNG`, extension `.png`, MIME `image/png`. Lossless, **no adjustable options**. Feature-detected (effectively always available).
- **How to choose:** A fallback to OxiPNG, which optimizes harder and usually produces smaller PNGs. Use Browser PNG only if you want the unoptimized native result.
- **Recommended starting point:** **Prefer OxiPNG** for smaller files; Browser PNG is the plain fallback.

### Browser GIF

- **What it does:** A GIF produced by your browser's built-in encoder — the only animation-capable path here.
- **Range & default:** id `browserGIF`, extension `.gif`, MIME `image/gif`. **No adjustable options**, feature-detected — and **usually unavailable**, because most browsers don't support GIF in `canvas.toBlob`, so it is filtered out of the list.
- **How to choose:** Only relevant for legacy GIF needs, and only if it actually shows up for you. For modern static graphics, PNG/WebP are far better. GIF's limited color palette makes it a poor choice for photos.
- **Recommended starting point:** **Avoid unless you specifically need a GIF** and the option is offered in your browser.

## Tips & pitfalls

- **Always keep one side on "Original" to compare.** It re-encodes nothing and is your honest reference for both size and quality.
- **Lossy ≠ permanent damage on the first pass, but it compounds.** Don't repeatedly export the same image through a lossy format; start from the best-quality source you have.
- **Don't save flat graphics or text as a lossy format.** WebP/AVIF/JPEG lossy will smear sharp edges and text into fuzzy halos. Use OxiPNG or WebP _lossless_ for logos, icons, charts, and screenshots of UI.
- **Don't save photographs as PNG.** OxiPNG will keep them perfect but enormous; a lossy WebP/AVIF/JPEG will be a fraction of the size with no visible loss.
- **JPEG has no transparency.** If your image has a transparent background and you pick MozJPEG or Browser JPEG, the transparency is lost. Use WebP, AVIF, JPEG XL, or OxiPNG instead.
- **Modern ≠ always safe to ship.** Ranked by how widely they open today: JPEG and PNG (everywhere) > WebP (near-universal) > AVIF (broad on current browsers) > JPEG XL (mainly Safari) > QOI (not a web format). Match the format to where the image will be used. (src: caniuse.com)
- **Smaller files cost encode time.** AVIF and high "Effort"/"Passes" settings are the slowest; JPEG/PNG/QOI are the fastest. If a side feels slow to update, that's expected for AVIF.
- **The Browser encoders are feature-detected.** If Browser GIF (or, rarely, another) isn't in your list, your browser doesn't support producing that type via `canvas` — that's normal, not a bug.

## Under the hood

The modern formats (WebP, AVIF, JPEG XL, MozJPEG, OxiPNG, QOI) run as WebAssembly codecs inside a worker, while the three Browser encoders use the browser's own `canvas.toBlob` on the main thread (`src/lib/compress.ts`). "Original" is the `identity` pseudo-encoder: it skips encoding entirely, hands back the source file unchanged, and reports 0% change. When you pick a real encoder, Sqush also decodes the result back to pixels so the "after" preview shows the true codec output — compression artifacts and all — rather than an idealized version.
