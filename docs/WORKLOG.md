# Worklog

Short session-by-session build log: what changed, why, and the gotchas a future
session must know. Newest first. (Live project state stays in
[STATUS.md](STATUS.md); this is the narrative trail.)

## 2026-07-05 — Rename-proofing + sqush.app sunset Worker

**Why:** the maintainer may rename the app again; a rename must be a small task,
not a project. Also fixed the zombie-service-worker trap on the old domain.

**What changed:**

- **Rename-proofing refactor** (Codex-executed, spec + review + verification by
  Claude): `src/shared/brand.ts` (`APP_NAME`) is now the only place the name
  lives in code; every internal identifier de-branded (`.editor-root`,
  `app-generated` alias, `__appEmscripten*` globals, `registerServiceWorker`,
  SW cache `app-${version}`, localStorage `app:*` keys — FROZEN schema now,
  renamed one final time while the domain cutover had client storage reset
  anyway; bulk ids `bulk-N`; `static/wordmark.svg`). Bulk ZIP download name
  still branded, derived from `APP_NAME`. Full details: runbook Phase E.
- **`infra/sqush-sunset/`**: Cloudflare Worker for the sqush.app zone — serves
  a self-destructing service worker at `/service-worker.js` and 301s all else
  to presk.app. NOT yet deployed (needs user: deploy + disable the zone's
  Single Redirect Rule — redirect rules run before Workers, so the rule must go
  for the Worker to see traffic). Steps: runbook Phase F.
- Living docs re-pointed at the new identifiers; `project-identity.md` now
  documents the (cheap) future-rename procedure; runbook gained Phases E/F and
  a reconciled user-action checklist.

**Verification:** `npm run check` green; full Playwright e2e 61 passed /
1 expected WebKit skip, both browsers (run by Claude, not just the delegate).

**Gotchas:**

- `wasm-bindgen` bakes Rust crate names into `.wasm` import strings — the
  `squoosh_*` codec artifacts CANNOT be renamed without a rebuild (runbook
  Phase B; fold into the next codec upgrade; build-green is NOT sufficient,
  only e2e catches it).
- The Codex sandbox can't bind the Playwright preview-server port; e2e must be
  run outside it.
