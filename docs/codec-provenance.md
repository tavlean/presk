# Codec provenance

This document records what the current repository contains. It is not a guarantee that every codec output is reproducible today.

The original Squoosh project committed generated JavaScript and WebAssembly outputs under `codecs/`. Sqush still relies on those committed outputs during the Rollup build.

Current inventory note: `codecs/` contains 80 committed JavaScript/WebAssembly codec artifacts, including browser builds, Node-targeted builds, threaded builds, SIMD builds, and worker companions. That means codec cleanup can reduce repository weight, but it also has a high breakage risk.

## Important rule

Do not delete or rebuild codec files casually. A codec change can affect:

- generated feature metadata;
- worker bundles;
- service-worker cache lists;
- browser support for threaded or SIMD WebAssembly;
- image quality and output size.

When changing a codec, rebuild only that codec first, run the full check, then manually test that codec in the browser.

## Build model

The inherited codec README says each codec subproject is built from its own folder:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

Most C/C++ codecs use Docker-based Makefiles. Rust codecs use `wasm-pack`-style package outputs. Some codec packages have their own `package-lock.json` or `Cargo.lock`; leave those alone unless actively rebuilding that codec.

## Local build metadata

The top-level codec package files currently advertise these build entry points:

Some package names are inherited and do not uniquely identify their folder, such as `codecs/png` declaring `oxipng` and `codecs/visdif` declaring `avif`. Use folder paths, feature imports, and generated asset references as the source of truth when planning codec cleanup.

## Local source references

The build recipes record these upstream source references. Treat them as the rebuild recipe inputs, not as proof that every committed `.wasm` was generated from exactly these inputs, because the repository still carries inherited generated artifacts.

| Codec folder        | Upstream source recorded locally                      | Reference recorded locally                                          | Notes                                                                                                  |

## Current product direction

The focused codec list being considered is:

- WebP 1
- AVIF
- JPEG XL

WebP 2 is intentionally excluded from this product direction. Keep the inherited
WP2 provenance notes for historical accuracy, but do not spend roadmap,
SvelteKit prototype, or migration-seams effort on WP2 unless it becomes a
serious product target again.

To reduce risk, first hide unwanted codecs from product UI after design discussion. Delete codec code only after:

1. The focused bulk workflow works.
2. Browser smoke tests cover at least WebP and AVIF.
3. A build confirms generated feature metadata and service-worker caching still work.
4. A branch or tag preserves the pre-deletion codec state.

Before deleting any codec family, also record:

- which `src/features/**` modules import it;
- whether it is an input decoder, output encoder, processor, or build-only helper;
- whether service-worker cache generation references its output files;
- whether browser smoke covers an equivalent replacement path;
- the exact files removed and the post-removal `npm run check` result.

## Remaining provenance gaps

The repo now records the source references present in local build recipes, but it still does not prove that each committed `.wasm` file came from those exact inputs. Before upgrading or replacing any codec, add:

- upstream project URL;
- exact upstream commit/tag;
- build command;
- Docker image or Rust toolchain version;
- generated output files;
- manual test notes and sample images.
