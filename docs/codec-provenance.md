# Codec provenance

This document records what the current repository contains. It is not a guarantee that every codec output is reproducible today.

The original Squoosh project committed generated JavaScript and WebAssembly outputs under `codecs/`. Sqush still relies on those committed outputs during the Rollup build.

Current inventory note: `codecs/` contains 80 committed JavaScript/WebAssembly codec artifacts, including browser builds, Node-targeted builds, threaded builds, SIMD builds, and worker companions. That means codec cleanup can reduce repository weight, but it also has a high breakage risk.

## Important rule

Do not delete or rebuild codec files casually. A codec change can affect:

- generated feature metadata;
- worker bundles;
- service-worker cache lists;
- browser support for threaded or SIMD WebAssembly;
- image quality and output size.

When changing a codec, rebuild only that codec first, run the full check, then manually test that codec in the browser.

## Build model

The inherited codec README says each codec subproject is built from its own folder:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

Most C/C++ codecs use Docker-based Makefiles. Rust codecs use `wasm-pack`-style package outputs. Some codec packages have their own `package-lock.json` or `Cargo.lock`; leave those alone unless actively rebuilding that codec.

## Codec assets not directly wired as current features

| `codecs/png/`       | Rust PNG helper package. The active PNG encoder feature uses browser PNG; active PNG optimization uses OxiPNG. Verify before deleting.                       |
| `codecs/visdif/`    | Visual-difference support utility. Not currently referenced from `src/features/`; verify before deleting.                                                    |
| `codecs/*/*_node_*` | Node-targeted builds used by codec examples or package tests. They are not imported by browser features, but may be useful when rebuilding/verifying codecs. |

## Current product direction

The focused codec list being considered is:

- WebP 1
- AVIF
- JPEG XL
- WebP 2 only as an experimental/hidden option, not a promoted production format

To reduce risk, first hide unwanted codecs from product UI after design discussion. Delete codec code only after:

1. The focused bulk workflow works.
2. Browser smoke tests cover at least WebP and AVIF.
3. A build confirms generated feature metadata and service-worker caching still work.
4. A branch or tag preserves the pre-deletion codec state.

Before deleting any codec family, also record:

- which `src/features/**` modules import it;
- whether it is an input decoder, output encoder, processor, or build-only helper;
- whether service-worker cache generation references its output files;
- whether browser smoke covers an equivalent replacement path;
- the exact files removed and the post-removal `npm run check` result.

## Missing provenance

The repo does not currently record exact upstream codec commits for most committed `.wasm` files. Before upgrading or replacing any codec, add:

- upstream project URL;
- exact upstream commit/tag;
- build command;
- Docker image or Rust toolchain version;
- generated output files;
- manual test notes and sample images.
