# Frisp Project Overview

Last updated: 2026-07-07.

Frisp is a browser-local image optimizer. Users import one image or a batch,
it decodes and processes pixels in the browser, and exports files or a ZIP
from object URLs. There is no backend image-processing service and no upload
path.

## What Runs Where

- SvelteKit renders a client-only static SPA (`ssr = false`, prerendered with a
  `200.html` fallback).
- Svelte 5 components and `.svelte.ts` modules own editor UI, bulk UI, session
  state, history, and result caches.
- Framework-neutral TypeScript under `src/client/lazy-app/` owns decode,
  preprocess, resize, quantize, encode orchestration, filename safety, and bulk
  reducers.
- Web Workers run codec and processor work through Comlink. The committed worker
  entry is `src/worker/codec-worker.ts`.
- WASM codec artifacts live under `codecs/`; committed source modules under
  `src/shared/codec-assets/` import them with Vite `?url` records.
- The service worker caches the app shell plus selected codec assets for offline
  reload after first load.

## Main Folders

- `src/routes/`: SvelteKit routes and app entry.
- `src/lib/`: Svelte editor/bulk UI, worker bridge, compression adapter,
  diagnostics, and service-worker registration.
- `src/lib/svg/`: the SVG vector-optimize lane. SVGO worker client, the
  deterministic auto-search with its multi-scale visual gate, SVG-to-ImageData
  rendering, and the optimize options/config. Loaded only via dynamic import so
  `svgo`/`fflate` stay out of the main bundle.
- `src/client/lazy-app/`: framework-neutral image pipeline, bulk engine, browser
  decode helpers, worker bridge runtime, and filename helpers.
- `src/features/`: codec and processor runtime modules.
- `src/shared/`: brand, stable shared contracts, codec asset records/modules,
  and worker-support helpers.
- `src/sw/`: service-worker cache-plan helpers and fixtures.
- `src/worker/`: committed codec-worker entry.
- `codecs/`: committed JS/WASM codec artifacts.
- `scripts/`: codec-wrapper patching, static-output audit, and hook install.
- `static/`: icons, fonts, headers, redirects, and static assets.

## Image Flow

1. `src/routes/+page.svelte` accepts picker, drag/drop, and paste imports.
2. `EditorSession` owns single-image side state, saved settings, undo/redo,
   decoded-source reuse, and the shared result cache.
3. Raster sources: `src/lib/compress.ts` delegates decode/preprocess/process/
   encode work to the shared image pipeline and codec worker bridge.
4. `src/lib/sveltekit-worker-bridge.ts` calls `src/worker/codec-worker.ts` for
   codec and processor work.
5. Vector (SVG) sources take a separate lane: `EditorSession` defaults the
   output side to `'svg'` and dispatches to `src/lib/svg/optimize.ts`, which
   runs SVGO in a lazy worker with a deterministic auto-search, gates each
   candidate on a multi-scale pixel diff, keeps the smaller of optimized vs
   original, and returns the SVG file plus raw/gzip sizes. Raster output formats
   stay available for SVG sources through steps 3–4.
6. Output components render before/after comparison from object URLs.
7. Single-image export downloads a file; bulk export writes a client ZIP.

## Build And Runtime

`npm run sync` only patches Emscripten/wasm-bindgen wrapper copies into
`.svelte-kit/app-generated/codecs/**`. Feature metadata, codec asset records,
worker bridge metadata, and the codec worker are committed source.

Threading is enabled for AVIF, JPEG XL, and OxiPNG. Chromium and WebKit use the
multi-thread variants when SharedArrayBuffer support is available; single-thread
fallback remains intact.

The production build uses SvelteKit adapter-static plus host headers for
COOP/COEP, immutable assets, and no-cache service-worker updates. `npm run check`
runs typecheck, build, and the static-output audit; `npm test` adds Vitest unit
and Playwright e2e coverage.
