# Bulk UI — design options & feature roadmap

Last updated: 2026-07-02.

> **DESIGN PHASE COMPLETE (2026-07-02).** Every open question is decided and

> implementation for Phase 2. Final calls: focus-first layout with the
> rich strip (S/M/L sizes; GRID MODE tried and REMOVED — the strip + stack
> cover everything); the STACK resting stage (wins over blank; dense,
> balanced, eased); right-panel scope model (coral global / azure image,
> tab + click-away); dots + azure-ring signaling; hero batch stats;
> multi-select (cmd/shift/drag, all-selected = global); remove-from-batch
> (Undo = production TODO); duplicates allowed pending renditions;
> per-image percentage resize semantics; divider-follows-the-image;
> Satoshi as the app typeface (shipped to production); the engine carries
> the normalized no-wasted-work recipe contract (63 unit tests). NEXT:
> the Phase-2 promotion spec (top-model session), then the build — ZIP
> export, app-boundary multi-file entry, folder import, and the lab→app
> migration with the cleanup list (blank state + Stack toggle removal,
> removal-Undo, parity-audit entry for the divider rule).
Status: in design → lab. Round 1: options written. Round 2 (same day):
maintainer confirmed **no separate `/bulk` route (A2 out)**, **ZIP in v1**,
and the **size-increase guardrail in v1**; concept images generated to
`~/Downloads/sqush-ui-concepts/`; §10–§12 added (A1↔A3 horizons, save
destination + settings panel, crop + export renditions). Round 3 (same day,
after reviewing the images): **layout goes to a two-variant lab** (grid home
vs focus-first home — §3); **left side becomes a dynamic contextual panel
with image info by default** (§4, rewritten); **override signaling decided**
(§5: dots; ring = selection only; no count badges); **A1 now → A3 later
confirmed** (§10); **save-back-to-source deferred** but kept on the list;
**folder import promoted into Phase 2** (§11). Round 4 (same day): the lab from
the layout section is BUILT and live at `/lab/bulk` (dev-only). Round 5
(same day): the lab was REBUILT on the real production editor components
(real EditorSession/Output/OptionsPanel; sparse-override sync), then a design
polish pass fixed the strip overlap + left-panel card nesting, and a THIRD
variant **L3 "flush left"** was added. Round 10 consolidated the lab into one
UI: grid is now the top vertical picker mode, L/M/S are focus-strip modes,
the L2/L3 variant toggle is gone, and the bulk path adopted the production
editor's no-wasted-work encode discipline. Round 11 (same day): strip fade
masks; remove-from-batch (hover ✕ + Delete-key; Undo = production note);
duplicate adds fixed and SANCTIONED as the interim multi-format pattern
(strengthens the renditions track's priority); drag-select from blank strip
space; the view picker re-homed beside the stage toolbar (top-right
rejected); and the **STACK resting stage experiment** (Stack|Blank toggle,
Stack default): the global/multi-selection stage shows a fanned stack of
the scope's images with a before/after split top card — the stage always
shows the work. **VERDICT (maintainer, 2026-07-02): STACK WINS over Blank**
— it is the resting stage for Phase 2 (remove the Blank state + toggle at
promotion). Iterations same day: same production dot-grid backdrop, a
WORKING stage toolbar (zoom/fit/background/smoothing), a REAL draggable
divider on the top card, full-size sources for every visible card (crisp
peeks), near-edge fan width, no hint/caption chrome, and (in progress)
space-driven peek density, even-count balancing, and eased leaf-through
motion.
This is the "Design First" step required by [road-map.md](road-map.md) before
any production bulk UI. Engine reference: [bulk-image-architecture.md](bulk-image-architecture.md).

## 1. Where we actually stand (surprising headline)

**The bulk engine is already built.** `src/client/lazy-app/bulk/` holds ~15
pure, framework-neutral modules — session/jobs, global-settings + sparse
per-image overrides (`getEffectiveSettings`, `getSettingsOverridePaths`),
scheduler with bounded concurrency, headless per-job processor, multi-file
import with MIME sniffing, stale-gated export planning with duplicate-safe
names, metadata-only snapshots, and ready-made view-models for a strip/detail/
summary UI. It is proven end-to-end (the diagnostics probe runs
`processBulkImageJob` through a real encode).

The maintainer's desired model — *global settings apply to all; touching a
control while an image is selected overrides just that field for just that
image; untouched fields keep following the global; badge + reset; Save All* —
**is exactly the model the engine already implements.** No engine redesign is
needed; this document is purely about the UI and the wiring.

What does **not** exist:

| Gap | Detail |
|---|---|
| Production UI | No production bulk route/mode yet; the current work lives in the dev-only `/lab/bulk` route |
| Multi-file entry | `<input>` lacks `multiple`; `EditorSession.pickFiles` keeps only `list[0]` (drop layer already passes the full `FileList`) |
| Production worker pool | The lab instantiates the proven two-bridge pattern; production route wiring still needs the same bounded pool |
| Production reactive wrapper | The lab has a `.svelte.ts` store wrapping the reducers; production promotion still needs a deliberate integration point |
| Thumbnails / memory | The lab fills thumbnails/previews and owns URLs; production needs the same lifecycle hardened with bulk e2e coverage |
| ZIP | No archive lib in `package.json` |
| Tests beyond Phase 0 | Phase 0 exists: 9 files / 63 Vitest cases. Browser/e2e coverage for the bulk UI remains future work |

---

## 2. Decision A — where bulk lives

| | Option | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | **Mode of the same route**: dropping/picking N files at the app boundary routes to bulk; 1 file keeps today's editor untouched | **Chosen path** — but as the *starting point* of a declared A1→A3 convergence, not a permanent split. See §10 |
| A2 | Separate `/bulk` route sharing the core | **Rejected by maintainer (2026-07-02).** |
| A3 | First-principles unification: *everything is a batch, single image = batch of 1* | The right *end-state* (every planned feature — crop, renditions, save-to-folder — is batch-shaped). Wrong as a *first step*: it rebuilds the proven editor before shipping any bulk value. Reached via the convergence rules in §10 |

## 3. Decision B — the main layout (the real choice)

Both serious options need the same focus/inspect surface (the existing two-up).
They differ only in what the **batch home** looks like.

### Option B1 — Grid dashboard + focus mode  ← recommended

- Dropping N images lands on a **grid of cards**: thumbnail, filename,
  `1.2 MB → 340 kB`, `▼72%` chip (amber `▲` if larger), status ring while
  encoding, a small **● deviation dot** when the image has custom settings.
- One **global settings panel** docked at the side; in grid view it always
  edits globals. A totals bar: "12 images · 14.2 MB → 4.1 MB · ▼71%" + **Save
  All**.
- **Click a card → focus mode**: the existing two-up editor (original |
  result) for that image, with a **mini-filmstrip** for next/prev
  (`selectNextJob`/`selectPreviousJob` already exist). Esc / back / ✕ returns
  to the grid — back-button works via SvelteKit shallow routing (`pushState`),
  the documented pattern for exactly this.
- Scope is **geographic, not modal**: grid = everyone, focus = this image.
  "How do I make a global change while an image is selected?" → you go back to
  the grid (one click). No mixed state, nothing to explain.

*Pros:* matches the maintainer's own description almost verbatim ("below each
image we see the information…"); true batch overview at a glance; scales to
dozens of images; size-increase warnings visible per card; mobile story is
clean (2-col card grid → full-screen focus).
*Cons:* most new UI of the options (grid + cards + transition), though
`strip.ts`/`summary.ts` already provide the view-models.

### Option B2 — Filmstrip + always-on stage (the old sketch in bulk-image-architecture.md)

- The editor keeps a **large two-up stage** at all times; a **bottom filmstrip**
  holds all images (thumbnail + size chip + deviation dot); the selected image
  fills the stage.
- The side panel is **scope-switched**: nothing selected → global; image
  selected → that image (needs a very explicit scope header + deselect
  affordance, because both states look alike — this is where the maintainer's
  "there should be no confusion" worry lives).

*Pros:* maximum reuse of today's layout; inspection always on screen; feels
like Lightroom.
*Cons:* weak batch overview (one image large, the rest are tiny chips);
scanning 30 results means reading a tiny strip; the global-vs-selected
ambiguity has to be solved with labels rather than geography; mobile gets
crowded (vertical two-up + strip + panel).

### Option B3 — Table/list view

Info-dense rows, pro-tool feel, but poor visual inspection — wrong identity
for a visual compare tool. **Rejected as the primary**; keep as a possible
density toggle on the grid later.

**DECIDED (maintainer, 2026-07-02, after concept images): two-variant lab.**
The pair is *not* B1-vs-B2 as originally framed — the images sharpened it:

- **Variant L1 — "Focus-first home"** (maintainer favorite,
  `bulk-focus-mode.png`): dropping N images lands directly in the focus view —
  big before/after stage of the first image, mini-filmstrip below for
  switching, batch card (totals + Save All + global entry point) top-left,
  per-image panel right.
- **Variant L2 — "Grid home"** (`bulk-grid-dashboard.png`): dropping N images
  lands on the card grid with the global panel; clicking a card opens the
  same focus view as L1.
- **Variant L3 — "Flush left"** — tried 2026-07-02 (stage/strip to the left
  edge, batch/info stacked under the right panel) and **REJECTED by the
  maintainer the same day**; removed from the lab (git history keeps it).

**DECIDED (maintainer, 2026-07-02, after using the lab) — the SCOPE MODEL:**
global optimization must live where users are trained to look — the RIGHT
panel. Import lands with nothing selected: the right panel edits the GLOBAL
recipe and the stage is a quiet resting state; clicking an image flips the
same panel to that image's effective settings; Esc / clicking empty strip
space returns to global; a subtle "All images | This image" tab above the
panel switches scope without deselecting. The left panel never hosts
settings — it is info-only (filename face when selected, count face when
not) with an always-present results-style footer (totals + Save all · ZIP).
Delta indicators use the production arrow everywhere (green down / amber
up). This scope model is a PRODUCT decision, not just a lab detail — Phase 2
implements it.

**Round 5 (2026-07-02, "surgical audit" + experiments).** Baseline fixes:
full type-scale pass; **color language: coral = global/batch, azure = this
image** (panel sliders recolor by scope, azure selection ring + override
dots); production dot-grid on the resting stage; numbers deduplicated (left
footer owns the batch result; right global footer is a caption); global
face gained Formats / Total size / Largest rows; compact <=900px layout —
strip + viewer controls never hidden, verified to 700px. Bug found via
instrumentation: the "re-encode on click" was the FOCUS PREVIEW re-encoding,
not the queue — the lab now hydrates the preview from the finished batch
output (**Phase-2 rule: never re-encode on inspect; reuse batch outputs**).
NEW experiment variants (both with per-thumb hover DOWNLOAD buttons and
5/12/30 sample loaders): **L3 "Rich strip"** — S/M/L thumbnail size control
(104/148/210px), richer captions at bigger sizes; **L4 "Adaptive dock"** —
the strip picks its shape from the count (big cells <=6, medium row 7-18,
dense wrapping dock >18). Toggle is L1-L4; awaiting the maintainer's pick.

**Round 6 (2026-07-02).** Maintainer signal: **L3 "Rich strip" is the
favorite**. Landed: (1) **hero stat block** — the left panel footer now
celebrates the selling point: big ORIGINAL → big OPTIMIZED (coral reserved
for the win), a proud "↓97% · 10.2 MB saved" line, Save all · ZIP
full-width beneath; encoding progress integrates with a subtle pulse.
(2) **MULTI-SELECT** (maintainer feature; built in the lab, and a keeper
for production): selection is a set — Cmd/Ctrl+click toggle, Shift+click
range, DRAG across the strip sweeps a live range; the scope tab reads
"N images"; edits apply the same override to every selected job;
**selecting ALL images routes to the global settings** (maintainer's
equivalence rule); Reset clears the whole selection's overrides; the left
panel shows a subset face (count + Formats + Largest over the selection).
Also same day: **Phase 0 landed on `main`** — Vitest bulk-engine suite,
9 files / 63 tests (`npm run test:unit` after the no-wasted-work additions),
test-plan §4 statuses updated.

**Round 7 (2026-07-02) — L3 FINALIZED as the layout direction.** With it:
(1) **the before/after divider follows the IMAGE, not the viewport**
(maintainer decision; `Output.svelte` gained an optional
`orientationOverride` prop, default-preserving, e2e-verified): left-right
compare stays on narrow screens for landscape/square images (w/h >= 0.95);
only clearly-portrait images flip to top-bottom. Candidate production
change for Phase 2 (log a parity-audit deviation when adopted). (2) size
picker went vertical (L→M→S, same thumbnail glyph at three sizes). (3) the
**mobile stack**: <=620px wide or <=500px tall — sticky hero summary bar
(totals + Save all; tap expands the info sheet), settings as a full-width
bottom sheet from a scope-colored FAB with the scope tabs on top, stage +
strip always visible; touch disables drag-select to preserve native strip
scrolling (long-press toggle = recommended follow-up). Open: L2 grid's
fate as a secondary view; L4 loses to L3 (remove at promotion).

**Round 8-9 (2026-07-02).** Detail polish landed (measured icon centering,
production download glyph on Save all, info rows Format → Size → Dimensions
→ Aspect, SI units confirmed). A dev font-comparison toggle was added, then
trimmed to Outfit / Geist / Satoshi per maintainer. **L1 and L4 removed**
(L3 finalized; toggle = L2/L3, default L3). Bug fixed: global Resize landed
on Custom 1×1 (the pseudo-side never got dimension seeding) — now seeds
real dims and lands on the 100% no-op preset. **The mixed-size-batch resize
question (§9 Q5) got its lab answer: PERCENTAGE presets resolve per image
(each scales relative to its own dimensions) at process time; Custom stays
fixed absolute pixels.** Verified: 50% halves every source regardless of
its size. Phase 2 should adopt this semantics.

**Round 10 (2026-07-02).** The variant question is collapsed into one lab UI.
The L2 grid is no longer a top-bar variant; it is the top option in the same
vertical picker as L/M/S. Grid shows the current card dashboard with the picker
kept visible at top-right; clicking a card enters focus view at the last-used
strip size; Cmd/Ctrl-click toggles, Shift-click ranges, and Esc returns scope
to global. The lab also inherited the production editor's no-wasted-work rules:
effective per-job recipe hashes include only the active encoder, collapse
disabled/identity resize and disabled quantize, resolve percentage resize per
job, restore previously encoded per-job outputs from a small URL-owning cache,
debounce selected override applies, and delay working badges by 500 ms. Sample
loading is now one "Load samples" button that creates 12 files.

So the two variants share the focus view itself; the lab question is **what
you land on and how navigating scope feels**. B3 (table) stays rejected as
primary; candidate for a grid density toggle later.

Reference images for the lab live in-repo at
[references/bulk-lab/](references/bulk-lab/) (`bulk-focus-mode.webp`,
`bulk-grid-dashboard.webp`, `override-signaling-dots.webp`).

## 4. Decision C — what the left side becomes

**DECIDED (maintainer, 2026-07-02): the left side is a DYNAMIC, contextual
panel.** Governing principle: **LEFT = what you're looking at + its tools;
RIGHT = compression settings for the current scope.**

**Default content — image info, always at a glance** (single-image mode and
bulk focus view alike):

- filename and **original format**;
- **pixel dimensions** and original **file size** — today you must open
  Resize just to learn the dimensions; that pain goes away;
- **inferred nearest aspect ratio** from the dimensions (1:1, 5:4, 4:3, 3:2,
  16:10, 16:9, 21:9 and portrait counterparts; label as "≈ 16:9" when not
  exact) — orients "what shape is this image" instantly;
- room for more (megapixels, has-alpha, EXIF orientation…) as needs appear.

**Dynamic tool sections take over / stack in the same slot:**

- **"Compare as…"** button — summons the second encode side on demand (the
  old always-on left format panel becomes an opt-in power feature; live
  two-slider codec A/B is preserved, just not the default);
- **Exports/renditions** (later — §12) live here when used;
- **Crop options** (aspect chips, size, reposition hints — §12) appear here
  when the crop tool is active;
- any future feature (the maintainer explicitly includes ideas as far out as
  layers) reuses this slot instead of inventing new chrome.

**Bulk grid scope:** the "thing you're looking at" is the batch itself, so
the left panel shows batch info (count, total original → optimized, savings)
+ the global settings + Save All — same principle, batch scope.

The right side stays the fixed compression panel for now; making it dynamic
too is noted as a possible future step, not part of this design.

## 5. Override signaling & reset — DECIDED (maintainer, 2026-07-02)

Style: the **dots** concept (`override-signaling-dots.png`), with one
reassignment — the coral **ring means "currently selected", never
"overridden"**:

- **Per-control:** a small coral ● dot next to each overridden control +
  per-control reset affordance; **no slider recoloring, no row tinting**.
  "Reset all to global" stays in the panel header (`applyClearJobOverrides`).
- **Thumbnail/card:** a small corner ● dot = "has custom settings". **No
  count badges** ("2 custom" pills rejected). Tooltip may list deviated
  fields via `getSettingsOverridePaths`.
- **Selection:** coral ring/outline around the thumbnail = selected. Ring and
  dot are independent signals.
- **Global changes** requeue only non-overridden stale jobs — engine already
  guarantees this (`applyGlobalSettings` → `requeueStaleJobs`).
- Per-image **format** override is allowed (engine supports it) — e.g. one
  logo stays PNG while the batch goes WebP.

## 6. Export — revising one old decision

The old plan said "individual downloads first, ZIP later". **CONFIRMED
(maintainer, 2026-07-02): ZIP in v1.** N programmatic downloads trip browser
multi-download blocking (bad first impression), upstream demand is explicitly
for ZIP (Squoosh #1428), and the memory argument is weak — outputs are
already-compressed blobs held in memory either way; `client-zip` (~2.4 kB,
streaming, STORE mode — no recompression) adds almost nothing. Per-image
download buttons stay. Save-to-folder is now a designed follow-up, not a vague
"later" — see §11.

Also **CONFIRMED for v1**: the **size-increase guardrail** (upstream #984) —
amber card when output ≥ original + a "keep original when larger" export
toggle (default on). "Never ship a bigger file."

## 7. Open items folded in from docs/upstream (so nothing is missed)

- **Mixed-size resize rule** (flagged unresolved in the architecture doc):
  global resize must be batch-sane. Recommend two global modes — *percentage*
  and *fit within W×H box* (the common "max 1600px" case) — with exact
  per-image dimensions only as a per-image override. Decide default at build
  time; preset chips exist (`sizePresets = [0.25, 0.5, 1]`).
- **Memory ceiling:** lazy thumbnails via `createImageBitmap(file,
  {resizeWidth})`; decode full-res only for focus + active encodes;
  concurrency stays 2 (engine default); revoke object URLs on remove/replace
  (`urls.ts` helpers exist).
- **Engine unit tests first** — test-plan §4 top-8 (queue counters, stale
  requeue, snapshot parse/restore, export dedup…) locks the contract the UI
  sits on. Pure logic, zero design dependency: ideal cheap-model work.
- **codec-options-model.md** pre-pays richer override panels, but v1 bulk is
  WebP + a small option set — don't gate bulk on that refactor; run it as an
  independent track.
- **Multi-Format Compare** stays a separate feature; the bulk worker pool is
  the same substrate it needs, so bulk-first builds its foundation.
- Later ideas kept on the list: folder import (+ preserved paths), PWA share
  target ("send 20 photos to Sqush"), presets (save globals as named preset),
  batch summary/CSV report, list-density toggle, target-file-size mode.

## 8. Recommended roadmap (phases)

| Phase | Contents | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — Engine safety net** | Vitest + `npm run test:unit`; top-8 engine tests, then the rest of test-plan §4; fix the stale ":covered with tests" claim in bulk-image-architecture.md | No design decisions; cheap-model executable; **can start now** |
| **1 — Layout LAB (active)** | One consolidated dev-only route: grid as a picker mode, L/M/S focus-strip modes, shared engine wiring, no-wasted-work reprocessing, multi-select and overrides (§3). Promotion decision still belongs to Phase 2 | Maintainer eyes on the lab |
| **2 — Minimum Useful Bulk** | Multi-file entry (input `multiple` + boundary routing) **+ folder import** (webkitdirectory picker + dropped-folder traversal — §11), reactive bulk store wrapping the engine, worker-bridge pool (2, per-side-bridge pattern), batch home per lab winner, global WebP panel (reuse existing panels), statuses/sizes/cancel/retry, totals bar, **Save All (ZIP)**, size-increase guard; bulk e2e smoke | Phase 1 winner |
| **2b — Contextual left panel v1** | Image-info panel (name, original format, dimensions, size, inferred ≈aspect — §4) + "Compare as…" button; ships in the single-image editor independently of bulk, then reused by focus view | Independent — can land any time |
| **3 — Overrides & focus** | Focus mode reusing two-up + mini-strip nav, per-image scope panel, per-control override dots (§5: ring = selection, no count badges), corner-dot card marker, reset (control/image), per-image format override, shallow-routing back-button | Phase 2 |
| **4 — Scale & polish** | Lazy thumbnails + decode LRU, mixed-size resize UX, AVIF as second bulk format, naming templates, presets, report, density toggle; **Settings panel** (§11; save destinations only if save-back is revived) | Phase 3 + usage feedback |
| **5 — Crop** | Crop as a `ProcessorState` stage (aspect + normalized focal point — §12): single-image crop UI, bulk global crop + per-image reposition via the override machinery | Phase 3 (override UI) |
| **Later track — Renditions** | One source → N named export recipes (§12): renditions panel, *(source × rendition)* jobs, grouped grid, naming templates | Phase 5 (crop) + own design pass |
| **Later track — A3 convergence** | Focus-mode parity checklist → flip single-file entry to a 1-item batch, retire `EditorSession` (§10) | Parity checklist closed |

Priority note: maintainer decision 2026-07-02 — **bulk now outranks
Multi-Format Compare** in the product order (road-map.md updated accordingly).

## 9. Design questions — resolution state

1. ~~Batch home~~ → **LAB** (decided 2026-07-02): one consolidated grid/focus
   lab replaces the old L2/L3 toggle (§3). Production promotion is still a
   Phase 2 decision.
2. ~~Left side in bulk~~ → **decided**: dynamic contextual panel, batch scope
   in grid view (§4).
3. ~~Single-image left panel~~ → **decided**: image-info panel + "Compare
   as…" button (§4) — not a chip; renditions join later (§12).
4. ~~ZIP in v1~~ → **confirmed yes**, with the size-increase guardrail also
   confirmed for v1.
5. ~~Global resize for mixed batches~~ → **lab answer**: percentage presets
   resolve per image; Custom remains fixed absolute pixels. Phase 2 should
   adopt unless new evidence appears.
6. ~~Override signaling~~ → **decided**: dots; ring = selection only; no
   count badges (§5).

## 10. A1 → A3: the horizon analysis (requested 2026-07-02)

A1 and A3 are not really competing layouts — they are **the same destination
entered from different ends**. The question is what you pay, and when.

**Short term (first shipping bulk, ~weeks):**

- *A1*: zero regression risk to the live single-image editor (the product's
  core promise, covered by the whole e2e suite); every step is additive and
  committable; bulk value ships soonest. Cost: a second reactive state layer
  (bulk store beside `EditorSession`) and two parallel signature systems
  (`sideRecipe` vs `settingsHash`) to keep in your head.
- *A3*: before ANY bulk value ships, the proven editor must be rebuilt on the
  bulk engine — undo/redo, the instant result cache, settings persistence,
  the per-file reset policy, and crucially the **two-slider format A/B, which
  has no equivalent in the bulk engine** (a "side" is a second recipe for the
  same job — a new engine concept). Weeks of porting, regression risk on the
  core workflow, e2e churn.

**Medium term (months):**

- *A1*: the feature tax appears — everything both modes want (crop, settings
  panel, save-to-folder, presets) needs wiring twice. The *logic* lives once
  (framework-neutral layer), so the tax is UI/wiring — real but bounded, and
  the codec-options-model refactor shrinks it further by making option panels
  model-driven and shareable.
- *A3*: one state model; each new feature built once; overrides machinery
  works everywhere (a single image with renditions = per-rendition overrides,
  for free).

**Long term:**

- *A1 unreconciled*: permanent 2× cost per feature and a codebase with two
  editors. This is the outcome to refuse.
- *A3*: clearly correct — every feature now planned (bulk, crop with global
  aspect + per-image framing, renditions, save-to-folder) is batch-shaped,
  with "single image" as the 1-item special case.

**Choose A3 outright now only if** you're willing to freeze user-visible
progress for weeks and absorb regression risk on the core promise — or if a
lab prototype shows the unified UI is trivially simple. Otherwise:

**The staged convergence — CONFIRMED by maintainer 2026-07-02 ("A1 now, A3
later"):**

1. **No new feature enters `EditorSession`.** Anything both modes want is
   built batch-first in the framework-neutral layer, surfaced by thin UI in
   both places.
2. **Bulk focus mode chases a written parity checklist** with the single
   editor: undo/redo, instant cache restore, zoom/compare, settings
   persistence. Every parity item is a step toward retirement.
3. **When the checklist closes, flip the entry point**: one file opens a
   1-item batch; `EditorSession` retires. A3 achieved without a big-bang
   rewrite — and if priorities shift mid-way, the app is still whole at every
   intermediate commit.

## 11. Save destination & the Settings panel (feasibility, requested 2026-07-02)

**"Save back to the source folder" is impossible in general** — browsers
never reveal where a picked/dropped file came from, and nothing can be
written to disk without an explicit user grant. But the **File System Access
API** (Chromium — Chrome/Edge; not Safari/Firefox) makes two flows real:

- **Open folder → save back.** `showDirectoryPicker({mode: 'readwrite'})`
  lets the user hand Sqush a folder once; the app reads the images from it
  AND writes the optimized outputs back next to them (or into an `optimized/`
  subfolder). A *dropped folder* also yields a writable directory handle via
  `getAsFileSystemHandle()`. This is exactly the "working in a folder"
  workflow described by the maintainer.
- **Save to folder… (remembered).** At export, a directory picker whose
  handle is persisted in **IndexedDB** (handles are structured-cloneable;
  never in `localStorage` — consistent with the existing rule). Next session:
  one "allow again?" click instead of re-picking. Multiple remembered
  destinations are possible ("Downloads", "Client X assets", …).

**Not feasible:** individually picked/dropped *files* — no parent-folder
access. (Chromium can overwrite a dropped file in place, but format
conversion changes the extension, so in-place overwrite is the wrong tool and
is skipped.)

**Fallback everywhere else:** ZIP download (v1 behavior). Feature-detect;
hide what the browser can't do.

**Verdict: feasible, moderate effort, Chromium progressive enhancement** — a
save-target module + permission UX + IndexedDB handle store.
**Maintainer decision 2026-07-02: DEFERRED — not in this roadmap's phases;
keep on the consider-later list** (this section stays as the feasibility
record). The **Settings panel** idea survives independently (Phase 4) —
starting small: "keep original when larger" default, and the standing rule
that whenever two behaviors are both valid, the choice becomes a setting
here later; save destinations join it if/when save-back is picked up.

**Folder IMPORT is the opposite: PROMOTED into this roadmap (Phase 2).**
Users will expect to hand bulk a folder, and unlike save-back it is
cross-browser feasible today: an "Open folder" affordance via
`<input webkitdirectory>` (works in Chrome/Edge/Safari/Firefox) plus
`showDirectoryPicker` where available, and **dropped folders** via
`webkitGetAsEntry()` / `getAsFileSystemHandle()` traversal. Recursive walk,
filter through the engine's existing `isSupportedBulkImage`, and keep each
file's relative path (`webkitRelativePath`) so naming templates /
structure-preserving export stay possible later.

## 12. Crop & export renditions — forward architecture (requested 2026-07-02)

Neither ships in bulk v1, but both are recorded now because they *validate*
design decisions being made today.

**Crop (planned feature).** Fits the existing pipeline as a processor stage
(crop → resize → quantize → encode) and — the important part — as **part of
`ProcessorState`**, so signatures, staleness, requeue, and per-image
overrides all work with zero new engine concepts. Design rule: store crop as
**aspect + normalized focal point** (`{enabled, aspect, targetW×H?, focalX,
focalY, zoom?}`), *not* a pixel rect — a normalized focal point survives
mixed image sizes and resize changes. Then the maintainer's bulk-crop
workflow ("set 1:1 · 1024 globally, click each image, drag what stays
centered, Save All") is literally: global crop setting + per-image focal
override — the exact machinery §5 already describes. Viewer work: a
crop-frame interaction mode on the existing stage
(`bulk-crop-mode.png` concept). Sequenced as its own phase after overrides
(Phase 5).

**Export renditions (later track).** "One source → several outputs" (as-is /
square 1024 / square 256 / wide 16:9…) for asset-pipeline workflows. Model: a
**rendition = a named partial recipe** (crop + resize + format + options);
a job becomes a *(source × rendition)* pair. The bulk engine's job model
already tolerates this — multiple jobs sharing one `sourceFile` — so the
constraints on today's work are only: (a) never key caches or state by `File`
identity alone (use source ids), (b) naming templates
(`{name}-{rendition}.{ext}`) become required with export, (c) the grid UI
should be able to group jobs by source later. Single-image renditions are the
`single-left-renditions-panel.png` concept — one candidate answer to "what is
the left side for". Bulk × renditions (12 sources × 3 renditions = 36 jobs)
drops out of the same model. Own design pass when its turn comes.
