# Manual QA checklist

Use this checklist before releases and after changes touching build tooling, workers, codecs, service workers, image processing, or editor behavior.

## Setup

1. Run `npm run check`.
2. Run `npm run preview`.
3. Open the preview URL in a browser.
4. Hard refresh once.

## App shell

- Page title is `Sqush`.
- Logo and drop target render.
- No visible error overlay appears.
- Browser console has no unexpected errors.

## Single-image workflow

- Open a JPEG file.
- Open a PNG file.
- Open a large photo and confirm fit, pan, and download still work.
- Open an SVG file and confirm it encodes/downloads through the selected output
  format.
- Open a WebP file.
- Open an AVIF file if one is available.
- Verify the editor opens for each file.
- Verify the before/after comparison renders.
- Change the output encoder.
- Change quality or another encoder option.
- Enable resize and change dimensions.
- Enable quantize if available.
- Rotate the input.
- Verify output size updates.
- Download the generated output.
- Use the back button and confirm the app returns to the import screen.

## Saved settings

- Change left and right side settings.
- Refresh the app.
- Reopen an image.
- Confirm saved settings are restored.
- Clear browser site data.
- Reopen the app and confirm invalid or missing saved settings do not break startup.

## Production-build behavior

- Run `npm run build`.
- Run `npm run preview`.
- Open the preview URL.
- Hard refresh.
- Confirm the app still loads.
- Confirm the drop target still works.
- Confirm the service worker does not serve stale broken assets.

## Playwright CLI smoke

Use the system `playwright-cli` setup documented at `/Users/tav/Development/docs/playwright-cli-system-setup.md`. Do not add Playwright packages to this repo just to run this local smoke flow.

Automated path:

```sh
npm run smoke:browser
```

This command builds the app, starts a production preview server, opens the app with `playwright-cli`, imports `src/static-build/assets/icon-large.png`, switches the output side to WebP, checks for an `icon-large.webp` blob download, enables resize, verifies a generated WebP blob is resized to `64x64`, verifies the output side can save versioned WebP settings, imports an extensionless PNG copy, verifies that it also exports as `icon-large.webp`, reloads the app shell while the browser context is offline, and fails if console errors are emitted during the flow.

Manual fallback:

1. Run `npm run build`.
2. Run `PREVIEW_PORT=5001 npm run preview`.
3. In another terminal, run:

```sh
playwright-cli -s=sqush-smoke open http://127.0.0.1:5001
playwright-cli -s=sqush-smoke snapshot
playwright-cli -s=sqush-smoke run-code "async page => { const file = process.cwd() + '/src/static-build/assets/icon-large.png'; const input = page.locator('input[type=file]').first(); await input.setInputFiles(file); await page.waitForURL('**/editor', { timeout: 15000 }); await page.waitForFunction(() => document.title.includes('icon-large.png'), null, { timeout: 20000 }); await page.waitForFunction(() => !document.title.startsWith('⏳'), null, { timeout: 30000 }); return { url: page.url(), title: await page.title() }; }"
playwright-cli -s=sqush-smoke run-code "async page => { const selects = page.locator('select'); await selects.nth(1).selectOption({ label: 'WebP' }); await page.waitForFunction(() => !document.title.startsWith('⏳'), null, { timeout: 30000 }); const selected = await selects.nth(1).evaluate(el => el.options[el.selectedIndex].text); const links = await page.locator('a[download], a[href^=blob]').evaluateAll(els => els.map(a => ({ href: a.href, download: a.getAttribute('download') }))); const bodyText = await page.locator('body').innerText(); return { selected, links, outputMentioned: /\\.webp|WebP|kB/.test(bodyText) }; }"
playwright-cli -s=sqush-smoke console error
playwright-cli -s=sqush-smoke close
```

Expected result: the upload navigates to `/editor`, the title becomes `icon-large.png - Sqush`, the output side can be changed to `WebP`, a blob download named `icon-large.webp` is present, and `console error` reports zero errors.

## Bulk roadmap checks

Bulk UI is roadmap work and is not part of migration closeout. Until
implementation starts, verify only the backend helpers through:

```sh
npm run test:helpers
```

When roadmap implementation starts, add browser checks for:

- multiple file import;
- per-image status display;
- global settings changes;
- per-image overrides;
- failed image handling;
- export-all behavior;
- object URL cleanup.
