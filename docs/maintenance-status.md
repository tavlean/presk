Next recommended tasks when work resumes:

1. Keep progress tied to [Progress dashboard](progress-dashboard.md) and [Agent guide](../AGENTS.md).
2. Continue extracting/tested framework-neutral logic from Preact components where it clearly reduces future Svelte migration risk.
3. Add browser smoke tests before significant UI or codec-surface changes.
4. Do not implement bulk UI until the workflow design has been discussed and iterated.
5. Use `docs/dependency-modernization.md` for dependency cleanup order; do not use `npm audit fix --force` blindly.

Quick investigation note:

- `rg "as any|: any| any[),;]" src/client/lazy-app src/features lib/test-helpers.js` currently reports no remaining matches in the main lazy app, feature code, or helper tests. The only generated `as any` text found is emitted by `lib/feature-plugin.js` for worker exposure.

## Completed baseline cleanup

- Added `npm run test:unit` as an alias for pure-helper tests.
- Added Node and npm engine metadata matching `.nvmrc`.
- Updated Node type definitions to match the supported Node 20 runtime baseline.
- Added `npm run format` and `npm run format:check`.
- Added `npm run smoke:build` to verify generated build output.
- Expanded `npm run smoke:build` to check generated Sqush metadata and absence of analytics code.
- Expanded `npm run smoke:build` to verify generated feature metadata and worker entry files exist.
- Expanded `npm run smoke:build` to guard against accidental external runtime scripts, runtime links, and manifest media.
- Expanded `npm run smoke:build` to verify service-worker precache assets exist in the production build.

- Added `npm run smoke:browser` to automate the local production-build Playwright CLI smoke without adding Playwright as a project dependency.
- Expanded `npm run smoke:browser` to verify the real editor writes versioned WebP side settings to `localStorage`.
- Updated CI to use current checkout/setup-node actions and run the baseline checks.
- Expanded CI to cover Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.
- CI matrix fail-fast is disabled so one platform failure does not hide the other platform results.
- CI uses read-only repository permissions, a 15-minute job timeout, and concurrency cancellation so superseded runs do not keep running after newer pushes.
- Removed the inherited upstream Google Analytics integration.
- Refreshed Browserslist data.
- Removed the Node 20 `DEP0190` warning from the TypeScript build spawn.

- Hardened saved settings parsing to reject missing or array-shaped encoder options.
- Hardened saved settings parsing to reject null encoder option values.
- Hardened saved settings parsing to reject invalid processor enabled values and null option values.

- Modernized one editor media query listener path.

- Tightened bulk settings merging so falsy overrides such as `false` and `0` remain valid per-image overrides.
- Added a settings override path helper for future per-image override highlighting.
- Hardened bulk queue transitions so missing or repeated jobs do not corrupt active-job counts.
- Hardened bulk queue scheduling so invalid, fractional, negative, or infinite concurrency values do not produce surprising runnable-job lists.

- Added session helpers for global setting changes and per-image override changes.
- Added detailed bulk progress counters for future batch status displays.

- Added `src/client/lazy-app/bulk/processor.ts` to process one bulk image job through the shared image pipeline without UI coupling.
- Guarded bulk processor percent-change calculation for zero-byte inputs.
- Added `src/client/lazy-app/bulk/runner.ts` to process queued bulk jobs up to the concurrency limit.
- Hardened the bulk runner so already-aborted batches do not start jobs or call processors.
- Added `src/client/lazy-app/bulk/urls.ts` to collect and revoke bulk preview, thumbnail, and download object URLs.
- Hardened bulk object URL cleanup so duplicate preview, thumbnail, and download URLs are only revoked once.
- Fixed SVG `viewBox` size parsing for comma-separated values using a tested helper.

- Added `docs/manual-qa.md`.
- Added `npm run audit` and CI audit enforcement.
- Removed the noisy Rollup unused external import warning by narrowing `path` imports in build plugins.
- Refreshed low-risk dependencies while keeping Preact pinned because the newer Preact 10 typings require a separate migration.
- Refreshed `preact-render-to-string` within major 5 for static prerendering without starting the Preact migration.
- Refreshed compatible Rollup 2 plugins and set `@rollup/plugin-replace` `preventAssignment` explicitly.
- Applied the non-force `npm audit fix` lockfile update for `brace-expansion`.
- Migrated the CSS build stack to PostCSS 8-era packages.
- Upgraded `@rollup/plugin-terser` to clear the remaining serialization audit findings.

## Current verification commands

Run these before committing substantial changes:

```sh
npm run format:check
npm run build
npm run smoke:build
npm run test:helpers
npm run typecheck
```

For UI-sensitive changes, also run a browser smoke check against `build/` after `npm run build`.
Use `npm run preview` for that production-build browser check; `npm run serve` is for dev output in `.tmp/build/static`.

On a fresh checkout, run `npm run build` before `npm run typecheck` because the build creates ignored feature metadata files required by TypeScript. `npm run check` already runs commands in the safe order and includes the helper tests.

## Remaining audit state

`npm audit --audit-level=low` currently reports 0 vulnerabilities.

Keep avoiding blind `npm audit fix --force`; future findings should still be handled as explicit dependency or toolchain tasks with verification.

## Local npm cache issue

The default npm cache at `/Users/tav/.npm` previously failed with `EPERM` in this environment. The manual ownership repair was run successfully:

```sh
sudo chown -R 501:20 "/Users/tav/.npm"
npm cache verify
```

`npm cache verify` now succeeds in the user's normal terminal. The Codex sandbox may still report `EPERM` against individual cache files, so use a temporary npm cache for Codex-run install/update commands if that reappears.
