# Maintenance status

Last updated: 2026-05-24.

## Resume handoff

Current branch: `main`.

Standalone GitHub repo: `tavlean/sqush`.

Default branch: `main`.

Project homepage metadata: `https://sqush.app`.

Historical archived fork, not the current project: `tavlean/SquooshPlus`.

Project identity note: see [Project identity](project-identity.md). The current app/repo/package name is Sqush. The local checkout has been renamed to `/Users/tav/Development/Tavlean/Sqush`. Any remaining `SquooshPlus` references should be historical fork references or temporary tool compatibility paths.

Active-thread path note: this chat is still attached in Codex to the old project entry `/Users/tav/Development/Tavlean/SquooshPlus`, which is a symlink to the real checkout at `/Users/tav/Development/Tavlean/Sqush`. For uninterrupted work in this chat, use the symlink path as the working directory. Best long-term fix is to start a new Codex chat from the real `Sqush` project entry and use this document plus `docs/progress-dashboard.html`, `docs/progress-dashboard.md`, `docs/todo.md`, and `docs/svelte-migration-context.md` as the handoff source.

Working tree at last update: progress dashboard reflects the Node 24 build baseline, browser smoke coverage for saved-settings import, real resize processing to a `64x64` WebP blob, service-worker-disabled app-shell loading, service-worker controller guards, refreshed browser support policy, static-build utility cleanup, shared filename sanitization, shared abort-error checks, local folder rename to Sqush, a wider direct-open HTML dashboard at `docs/progress-dashboard.html`, `npm run dashboard` for change-triggered dashboard reloads with graceful already-running detection, and expanded single-image pure helpers. Bulk helpers include a framework-neutral barrel export, import-to-session helper, append-import helper, structured import rejection reasons and summary counts, shared SVG-aware source decode path, process-plan helper, selected-job detail selector, queue-state selector, shared queue counter deltas across direct and batch transitions, export-plan completion helper, drift-tolerant session counters, strip item selectors, queue-aware session summary selectors, and metadata-only snapshot restore from parsed or serialized snapshots for future UI/Svelte consumption. Single-image editor work planning, work-start scheduling, side encode decisions, planned current/latest image job-state derivation, display settings, result labels, image-contain decisions, render display selectors, processor enabled toggles, processor option merges, default source resize side updates, orientation resize side updates, preprocessor-change state updates, side loading/result updates, side undo restoration, saved-settings key/label/payload construction, saved-settings availability, side-copy URL behavior, side reset URL cleanup, side settings mutations, default/saved side-state updates, unmount URL cleanup, document-title/loading selectors, new-file lifecycle handling, editor update effects, and supported encoder filtering are partly extracted or modernized. Browser smoke now covers real saved-settings import. Project identity is documented so the old archive name is not confused with current Sqush branding. Run `git status --short --branch` for the exact state.

Next recommended tasks when work resumes:

1. Start the next Codex session from the real project folder `/Users/tav/Development/Tavlean/Sqush` if possible. Use this document, [Progress dashboard](progress-dashboard.md), [visual dashboard](progress-dashboard.html), [Todo](todo.md), and [Svelte migration context](svelte-migration-context.md) as handoff context.
2. Continue extracting/tested framework-neutral logic from Preact components where it clearly reduces future Svelte migration risk.
3. Use [Svelte migration context](svelte-migration-context.md) before Svelte-adjacent refactors so new helpers stay aligned with Svelte 5/SvelteKit best practices.
4. Add browser smoke tests before significant UI or codec-surface changes.
5. Do not implement bulk UI until the workflow design has been discussed and iterated.
6. Use `docs/dependency-modernization.md` for dependency cleanup order; do not use `npm audit fix --force` blindly.
7. For live status viewing, run `npm run dashboard` and open the printed `http://localhost:4177` URL. The dashboard reloads only when `docs/progress-dashboard.html` changes.

Quick investigation note:

- `rg "as any|: any| any[),;]" src/client/lazy-app src/features lib/test-helpers.js` currently reports no remaining matches in the main lazy app, feature code, or helper tests. The only generated `as any` text found is emitted by `lib/feature-plugin.js` for worker exposure.

- Expanded `npm run smoke:build` to check generated Sqush metadata and absence of analytics code.
- Expanded `npm run smoke:build` to verify generated feature metadata and worker entry files exist.
- Expanded `npm run smoke:build` to guard against accidental external runtime scripts, runtime links, and manifest media.
- Expanded `npm run smoke:build` to verify service-worker precache assets exist in the production build.

- Updated CI to use current checkout/setup-node actions and run the baseline checks.
- Expanded CI to cover Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.
- CI matrix fail-fast is disabled so one platform failure does not hide the other platform results.
- CI uses read-only repository permissions, a 15-minute job timeout, and concurrency cancellation so superseded runs do not keep running after newer pushes.
- Removed the inherited upstream Google Analytics integration.
- Refreshed Browserslist data.
- Removed the old Node `DEP0190` warning from the TypeScript build spawn.
- Upgraded the local static server from `serve@11` to `serve@14`.

- Centralized saved-settings storage reads/writes and fixed the right-side settings event listener cleanup path.
- Modernized one editor media query listener path.

- Added `src/client/lazy-app/bulk/processor.ts` to process one bulk image job through the shared image pipeline without UI coupling.
- Guarded bulk processor percent-change calculation for zero-byte inputs.
- Added `src/client/lazy-app/bulk/runner.ts` to process queued bulk jobs up to the concurrency limit.
- Hardened the bulk runner so already-aborted batches do not start jobs or call processors.
- Added `src/client/lazy-app/bulk/urls.ts` to collect and revoke bulk preview, thumbnail, and download object URLs.
- Hardened bulk object URL cleanup so duplicate preview, thumbnail, and download URLs are only revoked once.
- Fixed SVG `viewBox` size parsing for comma-separated values using a tested helper.

- Added `docs/manual-qa.md`.
- Added `npm run audit` and CI audit enforcement.
- Removed the noisy Rollup unused external import warning by narrowing `path` imports in build plugins.
- Refreshed low-risk dependencies while keeping Preact pinned because the newer Preact 10 typings require a separate migration.
- Refreshed `preact-render-to-string` within major 5 for static prerendering without starting the Preact migration.
- Refreshed compatible Rollup 2 plugins and set `@rollup/plugin-replace` `preventAssignment` explicitly.
- Applied the non-force `npm audit fix` lockfile update for `brace-expansion`.
- Migrated the CSS build stack to PostCSS 8-era packages.
- Upgraded `@rollup/plugin-terser` to clear the remaining serialization audit findings.

## Current verification commands

Run these before committing substantial changes:

```sh
npm run format:check
npm run build
npm run smoke:build
npm run test:helpers
npm run typecheck
```

For UI-sensitive changes, also run a browser smoke check against `build/` after `npm run build`.
Use `npm run preview` for that production-build browser check; `npm run serve` is for dev output in `.tmp/build/static`.

On a fresh checkout, run `npm run build` before `npm run typecheck` because the build creates ignored feature metadata files required by TypeScript. `npm run check` already runs commands in the safe order and includes the helper tests.

## Remaining audit state

`npm audit --audit-level=low` currently reports 0 vulnerabilities.

Keep avoiding blind `npm audit fix --force`; future findings should still be handled as explicit dependency or toolchain tasks with verification.

## Local npm cache issue

The default npm cache at `/Users/tav/.npm` previously failed with `EPERM` in this environment. The manual ownership repair was run successfully:

```sh
sudo chown -R 501:20 "/Users/tav/.npm"
npm cache verify
```

`npm cache verify` now succeeds in the user's normal terminal. The Codex sandbox may still report `EPERM` against individual cache files, so use a temporary npm cache for Codex-run install/update commands if that reappears.
