Next recommended tasks when work resumes:

1. Keep progress tied to [Progress dashboard](progress-dashboard.md) and [Agent guide](../AGENTS.md).
2. Continue extracting/tested framework-neutral logic from Preact components where it clearly reduces future Svelte migration risk.
3. Add browser smoke tests before significant UI or codec-surface changes.
4. Do not implement bulk UI until the workflow design has been discussed and iterated.
5. Use `docs/dependency-modernization.md` for dependency cleanup order; do not use `npm audit fix --force` blindly.

Quick investigation note:

- `src/client/lazy-app/image-pipeline.ts` still has an `as any` around encoder options. This is caused by generated `encoderMap` union typing. Do not rush this under time pressure; fix it with generated type improvements or a well-typed dispatch helper.

## Completed baseline cleanup

- Added project documentation and a road map.
- Added an issue-list backlog seed.
- Added a progress dashboard to keep cleanup, simplification, bulk, and Svelte migration readiness aligned.
- Added an agent guide to keep future work aligned with the product and maintenance mission.
- Added an initial browser support policy note.
- Documented first public browser support targets and release gates for local/offline optimization reliability.
- Added `npm run typecheck`.
- Added `npm test` as an alias for the full baseline check.
- Added `npm run test:unit` as an alias for pure-helper tests.
- Added Node and npm engine metadata matching `.nvmrc`.
- Added `npm run format` and `npm run format:check`.
- Added `npm run smoke:build` to verify generated build output.
- Expanded `npm run smoke:build` to check generated Sqush metadata and absence of analytics code.
- Expanded `npm run smoke:build` to verify generated feature metadata and worker entry files exist.
- Expanded `npm run smoke:build` to guard against accidental external runtime scripts, runtime links, and manifest media.
- Added `npm run preview` to serve the production `build/` directory.
- Documented and verified a Playwright CLI smoke flow for the production app shell and local-image editor import path.
- Updated CI to use current checkout/setup-node actions and run the baseline checks.
- Expanded CI to cover Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.
- CI matrix fail-fast is disabled so one platform failure does not hide the other platform results.
- Removed the inherited upstream Google Analytics integration.
- Refreshed Browserslist data.
- Removed the Node 20 `DEP0190` warning from the TypeScript build spawn.
- Upgraded the local static server from `serve@11` to `serve@14`.
- Applied compatible `npm audit fix` updates.
- Replaced `npm-run-all` with a local dev runner script.
- Hardened saved side settings against invalid `localStorage` data.
- Added versioned saved side settings serialization while preserving legacy saved settings.
- Hardened saved settings parsing to reject array-shaped payloads.
- Hardened saved settings parsing to reject missing or array-shaped encoder options.
- Hardened saved settings parsing to reject invalid processor enabled values and null option values.
- Modernized one editor media query listener path.
- Replaced avoidable `any` types in shared DOM input helpers and gesture prevention.
- Replaced the shared shallow object comparison helper's public `any` types with object types.
- Replaced avoidable public `any` types in the shared immutable update helper with `unknown`/object types.
- Replaced avoidable public `any` types in the generated worker bridge dispatch with `unknown`/method types.
- Replaced avoidable `any` casts in the result cache processor-state comparison.
- Added framework-neutral bulk settings, session, import, queue, and stale-output helpers.
- Extracted and tested processor-state equivalence logic from the Preact editor component.
- Tightened bulk override detection so empty nested override objects are not treated as real overrides.
- Tightened bulk settings merging so falsy overrides such as `false` and `0` remain valid per-image overrides.
- Added a settings override path helper for future per-image override highlighting.
- Hardened bulk queue transitions so missing or repeated jobs do not corrupt active-job counts.
- Hardened bulk queue/session bookkeeping so removed or stale exported jobs keep exported counts consistent.
- Added a bulk queue retry helper for failed and skipped jobs.
- Added framework-neutral bulk export helpers for exportable jobs and batch size summaries.
- Added bulk export entry naming helpers for duplicate-safe future batch downloads.
- Hardened bulk export filenames for invalid characters, punctuation-only names, hidden-style names, and deterministic case-insensitive duplicate checks.
- Added session helpers for global setting changes and per-image override changes.
- Added detailed bulk progress counters for future batch status displays.
- Hardened bulk session imports so repeated files receive unique job IDs.
- Added a bulk import extension fallback for image files with missing MIME types.

- Fixed SVG `viewBox` size parsing for comma-separated values using a tested helper.
- Replaced POSIX-only `dev` and `serve` script syntax with Node wrappers for better Windows compatibility.
- Documented the full current upstream open PR audit in `docs/upstream-pr-notes.md`.

- Added `docs/manual-qa.md`.
- Added `npm run audit` and CI audit enforcement.
- Removed the noisy Rollup unused external import warning by narrowing `path` imports in build plugins.

- Migrated the CSS build stack to PostCSS 8-era packages.
- Upgraded `@rollup/plugin-terser` to clear the remaining serialization audit findings.

## Current verification commands

Run these before committing substantial changes:

```sh
npm run format:check
npm run build
npm run smoke:build
npm run test:helpers
npm run typecheck
```

For UI-sensitive changes, also run a browser smoke check against `build/` after `npm run build`.
Use `npm run preview` for that production-build browser check; `npm run serve` is for dev output in `.tmp/build/static`.

On a fresh checkout, run `npm run build` before `npm run typecheck` because the build creates ignored feature metadata files required by TypeScript. `npm run check` already runs commands in the safe order and includes the helper tests.

## Remaining audit state

`npm audit --audit-level=low` currently reports 0 vulnerabilities.

Keep avoiding blind `npm audit fix --force`; future findings should still be handled as explicit dependency or toolchain tasks with verification.

## Local npm cache issue

The default npm cache at `/Users/tav/.npm` previously failed with `EPERM` in this environment. The manual ownership repair was run successfully:

```sh
sudo chown -R 501:20 "/Users/tav/.npm"
npm cache verify
```

`npm cache verify` now succeeds in the user's normal terminal. The Codex sandbox may still report `EPERM` against individual cache files, so use a temporary npm cache for Codex-run install/update commands if that reappears.
