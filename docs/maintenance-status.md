# Maintenance status

Last updated: 2026-05-23.

## Resume handoff

Current branch: `dev`.

Working tree at last update: clean.

Latest committed maintenance work:

- `f4d1a08` Clarify npm cache status
- `a930ac9` Update maintenance status
- `ba6467c` Replace npm-run-all dev runner
- `8c54731` Clarify generated feature files
- `15b3662` Link maintenance status doc

Latest verification run:

- `npm run format:check`: passed.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run build && npm run smoke:build`: passed.
- Playwright CLI production-build smoke: passed, with `Squoosh` title, file input present, and zero console messages.

Next recommended tasks:

1. Add a repeatable browser smoke command or script so the Playwright check is not only manual.
2. Decide whether to fix the Rollup unused external import warning now or leave it for the larger Rollup/toolchain upgrade.
3. Start bulk-image feature design in framework-neutral TypeScript modules before touching UI heavily.
4. Keep remaining `npm audit` work as explicit build-tooling upgrade tasks; do not use `npm audit fix --force` blindly.

## Completed baseline cleanup

- Added project documentation and a road map.
- Added `npm run typecheck`.
- Added `npm run format` and `npm run format:check`.
- Added `npm run smoke:build` to verify generated build output.
- Added `npm run preview` to serve the production `build/` directory.
- Updated CI to use current checkout/setup-node actions and run the baseline checks.
- Removed the inherited upstream Google Analytics integration.
- Refreshed Browserslist data.
- Removed the Node 20 `DEP0190` warning from the TypeScript build spawn.
- Upgraded the local static server from `serve@11` to `serve@14`.
- Applied compatible `npm audit fix` updates.
- Replaced `npm-run-all` with a local dev runner script.
- Hardened saved side settings against invalid `localStorage` data.
- Modernized one editor media query listener path.

## Current verification commands

Run these before committing substantial changes:

```sh
npm run format:check
npm run build
npm run smoke:build
npm run typecheck
```

For UI-sensitive changes, also run a browser smoke check against `build/` after `npm run build`.
Use `npm run preview` for that production-build browser check; `npm run serve` is for dev output in `.tmp/build/static`.

On a fresh checkout, run `npm run build` before `npm run typecheck` because the build creates ignored feature metadata files required by TypeScript. `npm run check` already runs commands in the safe order.

## Current known warnings

`npm run build` succeeds, but after compatible dependency updates Rollup reports unused external `path.sep` imports while loading `rollup.config.js`.

This warning appears to come from the old custom Rollup/TypeScript build setup, not from broken app output. The production app was smoke-tested in Chromium through Playwright after the warning appeared.

Treat this as part of the future Rollup/toolchain modernization work rather than as a blocker for bulk-image feature design.

## Remaining audit state

`npm audit` is reduced but still not clean. The remaining findings are mainly in old build tooling:

- PostCSS/cssnano ecosystem packages.
- Rollup/terser-related packages.
- Older glob/minimatch chains used by build utilities.

Do not run `npm audit fix --force` blindly. The remaining fixes require breaking upgrades and should be handled as explicit toolchain migration tasks with browser verification.

## Local npm cache issue

The default npm cache at `/Users/tav/.npm` previously failed with `EPERM` in this environment. The manual ownership repair was run successfully:

```sh
sudo chown -R 501:20 "/Users/tav/.npm"
npm cache verify
```

`npm cache verify` now succeeds in the user's normal terminal. The Codex sandbox may still report `EPERM` against individual cache files, so use a temporary npm cache for Codex-run install/update commands if that reappears.
