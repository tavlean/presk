# New-Codec Investigation — Researched, NOT Added

Last updated: 2026-07-11. Status: **investigation record — two verdicts
superseded (see below); SVGO/HEIC still open.**

This doc records a research pass on four candidate new codecs/processors that
came out of the codec audit ([codec-upgrade-audit.md](codec-upgrade-audit.md)
§4–5). **None of these are wired into the app.** This is decision material, not a
plan to execute — each entry says what it would add, whether a usable
browser/WASM build exists, the effort, and a recommendation. Re-decide when you
have appetite; the WASM build toolchain (emcc/cmake/wasm-pack/docker) is not
installed here, so anything needing a codec recompile cannot be done in this repo
as-is.

## TL;DR

| Candidate | What it adds | Recommendation |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **SVGO v4** (SVG/vector optimizer) | Optimizes SVG/vector files the raster pipeline can't touch | **KEEP — do first.** Pure JS, official browser bundle, no WASM/toolchain. |
| **libheif decode-only HEIC input** | Opens iPhone `.heic` (browsers can't decode it), convert out | **LATER.** Strong, but defer for LGPL + WASM weight; do SVGO first. |
| **jpegli WASM encoder** | Better quality-per-byte standard `.jpg` than MozJPEG | **SUPERSEDED 2026-07-11 → BUILD**: [specs/2026-07-11-jpegli-codec.md](specs/2026-07-11-jpegli-codec.md) |
| **Lossless JPEG→JXL transcode** | Recompress `.jpg` to `.jxl` ~20% smaller, reversible | **SUPERSEDED 2026-07-11 → BUILD** (after the jxl 0.12 upgrade): [specs/2026-07-11-jpeg-to-jxl-transcode.md](specs/2026-07-11-jpeg-to-jxl-transcode.md) |

The one to act on first is **SVGO**: it is the only candidate that adds a format
the app cannot handle today, and it needs no codec toolchain.

## 1. SVGO v4 — SVG / vector optimization — **KEEP / do first**

- **What it adds:** Optimizes SVG/vector files, which the raster codec pipeline
  cannot touch at all. Complements the existing codecs rather than competing with
  them — it is the only candidate that adds a *format the app cannot handle
  today*.
- **WASM feasibility:** Best of the four. **Pure JS, no WASM**, with an official
  browser bundle (`import svgo/browser`), Worker-friendly. v4.0.0 shipped June
  2025 (current 4.0.1).
- **Effort:** Low-to-moderate, all TS/Svelte — no codec build. ~780 KB lazy
  bundle. Work is: add SVG detection, an "optimize" processor, and a small UI.
  Note v4 disables `removeViewBox` and `removeTitle` by default (behavior change
  from v3 to be aware of when porting any preset).
- **Maturity:** Mature and active; v4.0.0 June 2025, official browser bundle.

## 2. libheif decode-only HEIC input — **LATER**

- **What it adds:** Opens iPhone HEIC files (browsers cannot natively decode
  HEIC) so a user can drop a `.heic` and convert it out to a supported format.
  **Decode only — never encode HEIC.**
- **WASM feasibility:** Strong. The maintained `libheif-js` (catdad, v1.19.8) is
  decode-capable, and the browser variant bundles the `.wasm` inside a single
  `.mjs`. License is **LGPL-3.0** — a deliberate licensing decision, not an
  accident, and the reason to defer.
- **Effort:** Moderate TS/wiring, **no codec build**. Sketch: decoder under
  `src/features/decoders/heif/*`, register the HEIC MIME/extension, add it to
  `src/shared/codec-assets.ts` and the SW precache plan
  (`src/sw/cache-plan.ts`), and lazy-load on a HEIC drop.
- **Maturity:** Mature. Upstream libheif (strukturag) is the de-facto library;
  `libheif-js` is active (v1.19.x).
- **Recommendation:** LATER. The candidate is strong, but defer for the LGPL
  license, the WASM weight, and the added surface. Do SVGO first.

## 3. jpegli WASM encoder — **SKIP now**

> **SUPERSEDED 2026-07-11.** Both blockers below are gone: the emsdk toolchain
> was installed and proven by the 2026-06 codec sweep, and jpegli is now a
> standalone project (google/jpegli, extracted from libjxl in v0.12.0). Decided
> → build:
> [specs/2026-07-11-jpegli-codec.md](specs/2026-07-11-jpegli-codec.md). The
> analysis below is kept as the historical record.

- **What it adds:** Better quality-per-byte JPEG than MozJPEG, producing normal
  `.jpg` output — a universal win that would benefit every JPEG export.
- **WASM feasibility:** No off-the-shelf browser/npm build exists. The libjxl
  WASM-encoder issue (#3454) is still **open**; the only fork is the stale
  `apenchev/jpegli` (RGBA-only, missing XYB, reads raw files); and `gen2brain`'s
  port is Go/wazero, not a drop-in C/WASM module.
- **Effort:** High. Needs emcc (**not installed here**) plus a wrapper and the
  full feature wiring.
- **Maturity:** Upstream jpegli is mature (BSD-3), but the **browser packaging is
  immature**.
- **Recommendation:** SKIP now; revisit if an official WASM encoder ships.

## 4. Lossless JPEG→JXL transcoding — **SKIP**

> **SUPERSEDED 2026-07-11.** The recompile blocker is gone (toolchain installed;
> the encoder rewrite is specced anyway) and JXL browser reach flipped (Safari
> ships it; Chrome 145 ships the decoder behind a flag, default-on expected H2
> 2026). Decided → build after the jxl upgrade:
> [specs/2026-07-11-jpeg-to-jxl-transcode.md](specs/2026-07-11-jpeg-to-jxl-transcode.md).
> The analysis below is kept as the historical record.

- **What it adds:** Recompresses a `.jpg` into a `.jxl` ~20% smaller,
  **bit-for-bit reversible** (the `cjxl` default behavior for JPEG input).
- **WASM feasibility:** Not possible with the current code. True transcoding
  needs the JPEG DCT bitstream path (`JxlEncoderAddJPEGFrame`), but Frisp's
  `jxl_enc.cpp` takes **pixels** and `jxl_dec.cpp` outputs **pixels**. jSquash's
  `lossless: true` is a pixel re-encode, not a transcode, so it does not give the
  reversible ~20% either.
- **Effort:** High. New C++ plus a libjxl recompile — impossible here (no emcc).
- **Maturity:** The libjxl transcode path is mature upstream, but it is **not
  surfaced** in Frisp or in jSquash.
- **Recommendation:** SKIP; it is recompile-gated and JXL browser reach is weak
  (~12% of browsers).
