// A tiny toast/snackbar store, the Svelte 5 equivalent of Squoosh's
// <snack-bar> custom element (shared/custom-els/snack-bar). Squoosh's
// showSnackbar(message, { actions, timeout }) returns a promise that resolves
// with the chosen action ('undo' | 'dismiss' | 'timeout' | …); callers use that
// to implement Undo. This reproduces that contract with a rune-backed store and
// a single <Snackbar/> component rendered once in the editor.
