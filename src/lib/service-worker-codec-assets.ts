// The service worker's only bridge into generated codec-asset land. It must
// stay free of `?worker` / `?worker&url` imports (those make the
// service-worker Vite build re-emit duplicate worker chunks the page never
// fetches) and of sub-inline-limit assets (the SW build ignores the app
// build's assetsInlineLimit and would inline them as data: URLs). The
// generated module below is curated for exactly those constraints.
