# Sqush SvelteKit prototype

This is a disposable technical prototype. It is not the production Sqush app and
not the bulk UI implementation.

The first milestone proves that a Svelte 5/SvelteKit static app can import
framework-neutral helpers from the existing Sqush source tree and build with a
service-worker entry point.

## Commands

```sh
npm install
npm run check
npm run build
npm run audit:static-output
npm audit --audit-level=low
```

## Current proof

- Uses Svelte 5 runes in `src/routes/+page.svelte`.
- Imports existing bulk helpers from `src/client/lazy-app/bulk`.
- Generates a SvelteKit prototype `client/lazy-app/feature-meta` module from
  existing WebP, processor, and preprocessor shared metadata before `check` and
  `build`.
- Imports a real committed WebP encoder WASM asset through a SvelteKit-built
  module worker.
- Encodes a synthetic 2x2 `ImageData` through the existing
  `src/features/encoders/webP/worker/webpEncode` module from a SvelteKit-built
  worker.
- Runs a WebP-only single-image pipeline probe from a locally generated PNG
  `File` through existing decode/canvas/process/export helpers and the existing
  WebP worker encoder.
- Builds with `@sveltejs/adapter-static`.
- Includes a prototype service worker using SvelteKit's `$service-worker`
  asset manifest, explicit codec asset references, and a de-duped install cache
  list.
- `npm run audit:static-output` verifies that static output includes the
  fallback page, service worker, module worker, WebP WASM asset, and
  service-worker cache coverage for the worker/WASM assets.
- Produces `build/index.html`, `build/200.html`, and
  `build/service-worker.js`.
- `npm audit --audit-level=low` is clean with a prototype-only `cookie`
  override.
- Local preview rendered in Chromium through `playwright-cli`; the page title
  and imported job list were visible. The worker/WASM probe reported the
  expected WebAssembly magic bytes, and the WebP encode probe produced a valid
  `RIFF`/`WEBP` payload.
- Local preview rendered in Chrome through Playwright with the WebP pipeline
  probe reporting a generated 155-byte PNG source, 4x4 decode, 3x3 processed
  image, 96-byte WebP output, `RIFF`/`WEBP` header, and export metadata.
- Runtime service-worker verification in Chrome showed the page controlled by
  the prototype service worker after reload, with Cache Storage covering app
  entry/start/route assets, the generated WebP features-worker, baseline WebP
  WASM, and SIMD WebP WASM.
- The WebP pipeline probe now runs through Sqush's shared Comlink worker-bridge
  runtime with a generated WebP-first SvelteKit/Vite module-worker entry,
  proving the first replacement seam for the production Rollup `omt:` worker
  bridge.
- The WebP pipeline probe now imports the framework-neutral
  `image-pipeline-shared` helpers for decode, preprocess, process, and injected
  WebP compression, proving the narrow single-image pipeline can run without
  importing the production Preact option components or Rollup `omt:` worker
  entry.
- The prototype sync step now emits generated WebP codec asset metadata. The
  service worker and SvelteKit worker bridge both consume that generated WebP
  WASM URL manifest instead of a handwritten local helper.
- The prototype sync step now emits generated rotate WASM asset metadata. The
  generated SvelteKit features worker imports the shared rotate runtime with a
  Vite `?url` WASM asset, proving the first replacement shape for production
  `url:` codec references without changing the current Rollup adapter.
- The WebP pipeline probe now runs rotate through the generated worker before
  resize and encode. Browser verification produced a valid `RIFF`/`WEBP`
  payload with `rotate=90` in the stage log and Cache Storage covering both the
  top-level rotate WASM and the worker-local rotate WASM fetched by the worker.
- The prototype sync step now emits a generated service-worker cache plan that
  uses the same `{ main, deps }` entry shape as production `entry-data:` records,
  but fills it with SvelteKit/Vite worker URLs and generated WebP WASM deps.
  The prototype service-worker asset list consumes that generated plan through
  the shared production `src/sw/cache-plan.ts` helper.
- The prototype service-worker registration now uses the shared production
  `sw-bridge` runtime helper with the SvelteKit-emitted `/service-worker.js`
  URL, proving the `service-worker:` replacement shape for registration without
  changing the current Rollup adapter.
- The prototype sync step now emits a generated worker-surface manifest. The
  SvelteKit worker bridge consumes its ready method-name list, while the same
  generated file records the worker methods still blocked by codec asset URL,
  thread-support alias, or stricter worker type work.

## Readiness verdict

SvelteKit static output is viable for Sqush's local-first single-image optimizer
architecture, but the production app is not ready for a direct migration yet.

The prototype has proven the platform path that matters most: a static SvelteKit
app can consume shared Sqush helpers, generate Svelte-safe WebP metadata, run
existing WebP WASM encoding and rotate preprocessing in Vite-built module
workers, register an offline service worker, cache the app shell and codec probe
assets, and keep runtime WASM lookup pointed at generated asset URLs.

The remaining blockers are migration seams, not a SvelteKit blocker:

- generated feature metadata must split framework-neutral codec data from Preact
  option entries;
- Rollup virtual imports (`omt:`, broader `url:`, `entry-data:`,
  `service-worker:`) need Vite/SvelteKit equivalents; the generated rotate seam
  proves the first narrow `url:` replacement pattern, and the generated
  service-worker cache plan proves the first `entry-data:` replacement pattern,
  and the shared registration helper proves the `service-worker:` replacement
  pattern;
- codec WASM asset URLs need a canonical generated source or wrapper patch so
  app code, workers, and service-worker manifests agree on runtime URLs without
  physical duplication.

The next production-facing work should solve those seams before building a
minimal SvelteKit single-image editor slice with real user-selected files.

## Findings

- Pure bulk/session helpers can be consumed from a SvelteKit app today.
- Generated shared feature metadata can be produced for SvelteKit without
  committing generated files or importing Preact option components. The current
  proof intentionally starts with WebP, Sqush's first production codec target.
- Full generated encoder metadata is not drop-in yet. AVIF, MozJPEG, QOI, and
  WP2 shared metadata currently import declaration-only codec exports or
  ambient `const enum` values as runtime values, which SvelteKit/Vite rejects.
  Those modules need type-only exports or local metadata constants before a full
  image-pipeline import can pass.
- The prototype also sets `verbatimModuleSyntax: false` because the current
  WebP metadata re-exports `EncodeOptions` without `export type`.
- SvelteKit/Vite can emit a browser module worker and real committed WebP WASM
  asset using native `new URL(..., import.meta.url)` and `?url` imports.
- SvelteKit/Vite can emit the small rotate WASM as a file when WASM inlining is
  disabled. This matters because the default Vite inline limit otherwise turns
  tiny WASM imports into `data:` URLs, which hides the asset from explicit
  service-worker cache evidence.
- The existing WebP worker encode module can run inside a SvelteKit-built
  module worker and produce a valid WebP RIFF payload from synthetic
  `ImageData`.
- A narrow single-image WebP path can reuse existing local helpers from
  SvelteKit today: `canvasEncode`, `sniffMimeType`, `builtinDecode`,
  `builtinResize`, `getOutputFileName`, `getPercentChange`,
  `getEffectiveSettings`, and `settingsHash`. This proves the useful seam is
  shared source/decode/process/export primitives plus codec-specific workers,
  not the full current Preact app shell.
- The first reusable seam has been extracted from the broad production `util`
  module: abort helpers now live in `src/client/lazy-app/abort.ts`, and browser
  image decode/mime helpers now live in
  `src/client/lazy-app/image-decode.ts`. `util` keeps compatibility re-exports,
  while the SvelteKit prototype imports the narrow decode module directly.
- The WebP encode path needs the prototype to alias `wasm-feature-detect`
  because the imported production source lives outside the prototype package
  root and bare dependency resolution otherwise starts from the repo source
  tree.
- SvelteKit's `$service-worker` build manifest does not automatically include
  the nested worker/WASM assets. The viable path is to expose codec asset URLs
  through generated `{ main, deps }` cache records and add them to the
  service-worker cache list explicitly. The generated cache records now use the
  shared `src/sw/cache-plan.ts` helper, matching the production `entry-data:`
  shape while using Vite worker and WASM URLs. The top-level WebP and rotate
  WASM URLs are also covered by SvelteKit's build manifest because the app
  imports those assets. The combined build and codec manifests are still
  de-duped before `cache.addAll` as a guardrail, because an earlier
  explicit-WASM version produced duplicate install-list URLs and made the
  service-worker install become redundant. Importing a worker URL from the
  service-worker build emits a second worker file, so the prototype also
  runtime-caches non-manifest GETs to cover the app worker after first load. A
  production migration should prefer a generated manifest that gives both the
  app and service worker the same worker asset URL.
- Importing WebP WASM assets explicitly for service-worker coverage while also
  importing the existing Emscripten modules currently emits duplicate baseline
  and SIMD WASM files. The current build emits three copies of each WebP encoder
  WASM: one top-level SvelteKit asset, one app-worker-local asset, and one
  service-worker-imported-worker-local asset. The prototype passes the
  top-level WASM URLs from the app module into the WebP probe workers and
  exposes them through Emscripten `locateFile`, so runtime Chrome verification
  now shows the controlled page caching the top-level baseline and SIMD WASM
  URLs without adding worker-local WASM URLs to Cache Storage. This fixes the
  runtime cache target for the proof but not the physical output duplication,
  because Vite still sees the generated Emscripten
  `new URL("webp_enc*.wasm", import.meta.url)` references and emits
  worker-local assets per graph. This is acceptable for the disposable proof,
  but a production migration should make codec JS and service-worker manifests
  share one generated asset URL per WASM file or patch the generated codec
  wrappers to externalize WASM URLs.
- The full image-pipeline import is still blocked by production-only Rollup
  virtual imports and Preact client option entries: `omt:`, `url:`,
  `entry-data:`, `service-worker:`, and generated `feature-meta` entries that
  merge metadata with Preact option components.
- The first `url:` seam is now proven for rotate: production keeps
  `src/features/preprocessors/rotate/worker/rotate.ts` as the Rollup adapter,
  while shared rotate logic lives in a runtime factory that accepts an injected
  WASM URL. The prototype generator supplies that URL from a generated Vite
  `?url` manifest.
- The first `entry-data:` seam is now proven for service-worker cache planning:
  production still resolves real Rollup entries at the boundary, but the cache
  planning logic accepts plain `{ main, deps }` records that SvelteKit can
  generate from Vite worker and asset URL imports.
- The first `service-worker:` seam is now proven for registration: production
  keeps the Rollup URL adapter in `sw-bridge/index.ts`, while shared
  registration/update/share-target behavior lives in `sw-bridge/runtime.ts` and
  the prototype provides the SvelteKit service-worker URL explicitly.
- The current prototype pipeline intentionally does not import
  `src/client/lazy-app/image-pipeline.ts` or `bulk/processor.ts`; those modules
  still pull the full encoder map, production worker bridge, and Rollup-only
  import schemes. A reusable migration seam should split source/decode/process
  helper primitives and injectable codec workers from Preact option UI and
  Rollup virtual modules before attempting a drop-in import.
- This prototype uses `ssr = false` because the app is browser-local and relies
  on `File`. A production migration should revisit whether selected routes can
  prerender meaningful HTML without touching browser-only APIs.

## Migration implications

- Replace the production Rollup `feature-plugin` with a SvelteKit/Vite-aware
  generator. The first Svelte-safe split should keep shared metadata separate
  from UI option components so framework-neutral helpers can import types and
  defaults without pulling Preact into a Svelte build.
- Continue extracting small framework-neutral runtime seams from broad
  production modules. The initial decode/abort seam shows this can be done
  behavior-preservingly while keeping existing imports compatible. The current
  prototype also proves WebP encode, resize, and an injected single-image
  pipeline surface can be split from Preact option controls.
- Replace the production `omt:` worker bridge with Vite worker imports. The
  prototype now proves the shared bridge runtime can be reused with a WebP-only
  SvelteKit module-worker adapter, but the full generated `features-worker`
  surface still needs incremental broadening.
- Generate the Vite-facing worker entry incrementally from an explicit ready
  surface. The current generated manifest enables `webpEncode` and `rotate`;
  full production parity is blocked by `worker-shared/supports-wasm-threads`,
  `url:` WASM imports, stricter worker `ArrayBufferLike` types, and non-WebP
  codec asset URLs.
- Replace production `url:` codec references with reusable runtimes plus
  generated Vite `?url` asset manifests, following the rotate preprocessor seam
  before broadening to the remaining codec surfaces.
- Replace `entry-data:` service-worker cache generation with `$service-worker`
  for the SvelteKit app shell plus generated `{ main, deps }` cache records for
  lazy/feature-detected workers and WASM assets, following the prototype
  `sqush-generated/service-worker/cache-plan.ts` proof.
- Resolve WebP WASM duplication before production migration. The likely paths
  are a generated Vite asset manifest consumed by both app and service worker,
  or codec wrapper changes that remove Emscripten's worker-local `new URL`
  references and accept externally supplied WASM URLs.

## Non-goals

- No production UI migration.
- No bulk UI implementation.
- No codec deletion or movement.
- No server-side image processing.
