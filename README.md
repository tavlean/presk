# Sqush

Sqush is a local-first image optimizer derived from [Squoosh]. Images are
decoded, processed, encoded, previewed, and exported in the browser. There is no
upload path and no server-side image processing.

Website: [sqush.app](https://sqush.app)

## Current App

The `svelte` branch is now the launch candidate. The app lives at the repo root
as a SvelteKit 2 / Svelte 5 static SPA:

- `src/routes/+page.svelte` is the single-image optimizer.
- `src/lib/editor/` contains the Svelte editor shell, controls, output view, and
  rune-backed editor session.
- `src/lib/compress.ts` adapts the Svelte editor to the shared image pipeline.
- `src/client/lazy-app/image-pipeline*` and `src/client/lazy-app/bulk/` remain
  framework-neutral engine code.
- `src/features/**`, `src/shared/codec-assets.ts`, and `codecs/**` remain the
  codec/runtime foundation.
- `src/service-worker.ts` is the SvelteKit-native offline service worker.

The old Preact/Rollup app has been removed from this branch. Use `main` only as
the historical safety net until the Svelte branch is accepted and merged.

## Developing

Use the Node version in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc). The package metadata expects Node
`>=24.12.0 <25` and npm `>=11`.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
npm run check
```

Useful maintenance commands:

```sh
npm run sync                 # regenerate .svelte-kit/sqush-generated/*
npm run audit:static-output  # verify emitted worker/WASM assets
npm run audit                # npm audit --audit-level=low
npm run format:check
```

`npm run check` is the normal local gate. It runs formatting, generator sync,
SvelteKit sync, `svelte-check`, production build, and the static-output audit.

## Local-First Contract

A working build must preserve:

- local import, decode, process, encode, preview, and export;
- WebP, AVIF, JPEG XL, MozJPEG, OxiPNG, QOI, browser encoders, and experimental
  WebP 2 parity unless a later product decision removes a format deliberately;
- object URL cleanup and downloadable outputs;
- static output with no image-processing server;
- service-worker/offline reload after the app has loaded.

Regressions in single-image optimization, codec workers/WASM, exports, or
offline behavior are release blockers.
