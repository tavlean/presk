# Privacy

Sqush does not send your image to a server. Image compression runs locally in your browser.

Sqush does not include the inherited Google Analytics integration from upstream Squoosh.

# Developing

Use the Node version in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc). The package metadata expects Node `>=20.16.0 <21` and npm `>=10`.

1. Install Node dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
1. Build the app:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
1. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

Useful maintenance commands:

```sh
npm run check
npm test
npm run audit
npm run typecheck
npm run format:check
```

Run `npm run build` before `npm run typecheck` on a fresh checkout so generated feature files exist.
