# Agent guide

Sqush is a local-first image optimizer. Its core promise is reliable
single-image optimization in the browser: no uploads, no server processing, and
dependable offline behavior after load. Any cleanup, migration, or feature work
must protect import, decode, process, encode, preview, export, and
service-worker behavior.

## Current stage

The launch path is the `svelte` branch and its worktree at `../Sqush-svelte`.
The app has been promoted out of `prototypes/sveltekit/` and now lives at the
repo root as a SvelteKit 2 / Svelte 5 static app.

The immediate focus is migration closeout: verify the root SvelteKit app,
service worker, worker/WASM assets, downloads, settings, responsive layout,
large/SVG inputs, and docs. Bulk UI and other new product work are roadmap
items, not migration scope.

## Boundaries

- Do not implement production bulk UI without maintainer/design discussion.
- Do not treat new product features as part of the Svelte migration.
- Do not introduce server-side image processing or upload paths.
- Do not delete or move codecs, generated metadata, workers, or WASM assets
  unless the build and runtime consequences are proven.
- Keep WebP as the first production codec focus, AVIF second, JPEG XL advanced,
  and WebP 2 experimental but included for parity until there is evidence to
  prune it.

## Engineering rules

- Prefer behavior-preserving changes that reduce risk or clarify ownership.
- Reuse existing framework-neutral helpers before creating new logic.
- Keep browser objects such as `File`, `Blob`, `ImageData`, workers, WASM
  modules, and object URLs out of broad reactive state unless measured.
- Run focused tests for pure helper changes.
- Run `npm run check` for app, build/tooling, runtime, service-worker, or docs
  changes.
- Use Svelte MCP/docs when creating, editing, or analyzing Svelte code. Run the
  Svelte autofixer after meaningful Svelte edits.
- Commit meaningful checkpoints. Push when CI feedback is useful or the
  maintainer asks.
